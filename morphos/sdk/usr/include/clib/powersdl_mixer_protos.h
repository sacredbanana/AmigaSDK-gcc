/* Special Effects API by ryan c. gordon. (icculus@linuxgames.com) */

/* Register a special effect function. At mixing time, the channel data is
 *  copied into a buffer and passed through each registered effect function.
 *  After it passes through all the functions, it is mixed into the final
 *  output stream. The copy to buffer is performed once, then each effect
 *  function performs on the output of the previous effect. Understand that
 *  this extra copy to a buffer is not performed if there are no effects
 *  registered for a given chunk, which saves CPU cycles, and any given
 *  effect will be extra cycles, too, so it is crucial that your code run
 *  fast. Also note that the data that your function is given is in the
 *  format of the sound device, and not the format you gave to Mix_OpenAudio(),
 *  although they may in reality be the same. This is an unfortunate but
 *  necessary speed concern. Use Mix_QuerySpec() to determine if you can
 *  handle the data before you register your effect, and take appropriate
 *  actions.
 * You may also specify a callback (Mix_EffectDone_t) that is called when
 *  the channel finishes playing. This gives you a more fine-grained control
 *  than Mix_ChannelFinished(), in case you need to free effect-specific
 *  resources, etc. If you don't need this, you can specify NULL.
 * You may set the callbacks before or after calling Mix_PlayChannel().
 * Things like Mix_SetPanning() are just internal special effect functions,
 *  so if you are using that, you've already incurred the overhead of a copy
 *  to a separate buffer, and that these effects will be in the queue with
 *  any functions you've registered. The list of registered effects for a
 *  channel is reset when a chunk finishes playing, so you need to explicitly
 *  set them with each call to Mix_PlayChannel*().
 * You may also register a special effect function that is to be run after
 *  final mixing occurs. The rules for these callbacks are identical to those
 *  in Mix_RegisterEffect, but they are run after all the channels and the
 *  music have been mixed into a single stream, whereas channel-specific
 *  effects run on a given channel before any other mixing occurs. These
 *  global effect callbacks are call "posteffects". Posteffects only have
 *  their Mix_EffectDone_t function called when they are unregistered (since
 *  the main output stream is never "done" in the same sense as a channel).
 *  You must unregister them manually when you've had enough. Your callback
 *  will be told that the channel being mixed is (MIX_CHANNEL_POST) if the
 *  processing is considered a posteffect.
 *
 * After all these effects have finished processing, the callback registered
 *  through Mix_SetPostMix() runs, and then the stream goes to the audio
 *  device.
 *
 * DO NOT EVER call SDL_LockAudio() from your callback function!
 *
 * returns zero if error (no such channel), nonzero if added.

/* Set the panning of a channel. The left and right channels are specified

 * This uses the Mix_RegisterEffect() API internally, and returns without
 *  registering the effect function if the audio device is not configured

 *  effect to be unregistered, since that is the data's normal state.
 *

 *  (distance) is an integer between 0 and 255 that specifies the space

 *  the precision of this effect may be limited (distance 0 through 5 might
 *  all produce the same effect, 6 through 10 are equal, etc). Setting (angle)

 *
 * If you need more precise positional audio, consider using OpenAL for

 *
 * If the audio device is configured for mono output, then you won't get
 *  any effectiveness from the angle; however, distance attenuation on the
 *  channel will still occur. While this effect will function with stereo
 *  voices, it makes more sense to use voices with only one channel of sound,
 *  so when they are mixed through this effect, the positioning will sound
 *  correct. You can convert them to mono through SDL before giving them to
 *  the mixer in the first place if you like.
 *
 * Setting (channel) to MIX_CHANNEL_POST registers this as a posteffect, and
