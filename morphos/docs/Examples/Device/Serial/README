This is basically a C translation & MorphOS adaptation of Iain Barclay's
8N1.device (see New8N1.lha, on Aminet), which is a rewrite of L. Lucius'
one (8N1.lha). It should be fully compatible with the 68k 8n1, but _not_
with the standard serial.device.
It has the same restrictions as the original 8n1, i.e. it supports only:

- 8 bits
- no parity
- 1 stop bit
- hardware handshaking (CTS/RTS)
- EOFMODE

It can send breaks, but not receive them.

I compiled it under two names: serial.device.elf and 8n1.device.elf for
convenience, but both are really the same thing.

Installation: just copy either 8n1.device or serial.device.elf (or both)
to devs:. Do not rename them, it won't work. If you want to change the
name, edit the Makefile and recompile.

This program is freely distributable. You can do whatever you want with
the source code.


Support: lesueur@club-internet.fr. Basically, if you want new features,
you'll have to add them by yourself.
