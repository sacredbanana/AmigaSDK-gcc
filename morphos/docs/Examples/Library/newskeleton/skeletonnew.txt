The newskeleton library should show you how to mix old mixed mode abox ABI
with the new PPC SystemV ABI inside ABox libraries.

The advantage of the old mixed mode ABI which defines the parameters in
certain virtual 68k registers is that such libraries can be called by
68k and PowerPC ABox code.
The disadvantage is that there is no defined FPU register model, the
number of arguments are limited and they don't match with the SystemV
varargs ABI.
Therefore we decided to also add the ability to define new systemv ABI
ABox library calls where you need no special gate code for the register
parameters and you aren't limited anymore about the library function
parameters.
The disadvantage is that you can't use that ABI for functions which
are called by 68k code anymode.
Anyway... you have all freedom in the functable definition as you can
mix old and new PPC ABI whereever you want, so it's possible to extend
system libraries with new API functions as these will never be called
by 68k anyway.

Before i forget it... it also uses the new extended resident structure
for the REVISION field. In the future we will also use the tags.
