mpegaudio.decoder/MMA_Sound_BitsPerSample

 NAME
   MMA_Sound_BitsPerSample -- [GQ], LONG. (V51)

 FUNCTION
   Decoder bit resolution. For this class it is 16 always.

mpegaudio.decoder/MMA_StreamPosFrames

 NAME
   MMA_StreamPosFrames -- [GQ], QUAD*. (V51)

 FUNCTION
   Returns number of sample frames (time points) pulled from output.

 NOTES
   This is a 64-bit attribute. Pointer passed to OM_GET must point to a
   64-bit variable. When using macros, use MediaGetPort64().

mpegaudio.decoder/MMA_StreamPosTime

 NAME
   MMA_StreamPosTime -- [GQ], QUAD*. (V51)

 FUNCTION
   Current output stream position in microseconds.

 NOTES
   This is a 64-bit attribute. Pointer passed to OM_GET must point to a
   64-bit variable. When using macros, use MediaGetPort64().

mpegaudio.decoder/MMM_Pull

 NAME
   MMM_Pull -- pulls decoded audio PCM data. (V51)

 SYNOPSIS
   LONG DoMethod(Object *obj, MMM_Pull, LONG port, APTR buffer, LONG
   length);

 FUNCTION
   Pulls specified amount of decoded PCM audio data.

 INPUTS
   port - this method may be only invoked on output port (port 1).
   buffer - pointer to destination buffer. Must be aligned to 16 bytes,
     preferrably allocated with MediaAllocVec().
   length - number of bytes to store in buffer. This number of bytes is
     rounded down to sample frame boundary (2 bytes for mono, 4 for stereo).

  RESULT
    Number of bytes stored. Zero means end of data, -1 means error. Error
    code may be obtained by getting MMA_ErrorCode attribute on the object.

mpegaudio.decoder/MMM_Seek

 NAME
   MMM_Seek -- seeks in decoded audio stream. (V51)

 SYNOPSIS
   BOOL DoMethod(Object *obj, MMM_Seek, LONG port, LONG type, QUAD
   *position);

 FUNCTION
   Seeks in decoded audio stream. It may be either frame seek (position is
   in PCM sample frames), or time seek (position in microseconds). Current
   seek is performed with MPEGA_seek() so is not very precise (about 0.1 s).

 INPUTS
   port - this method may be only invoked on output port (port 1).
   type - type of seek, MMM_SEEK_FRAMES or MMM_SEEK_TIME allowed here.
   position - requested position in data, relative to the beginning of
     output.

 RESULT
   Boolean, TRUE for success. If FALSE, error code may be obtained by
   getting MMA_ErrorCode attribute.

 NOTES
   Backward seek will fail if data source is not seekable. Forward seek in
   this case is safe, but will be slow for large offsets.

 DESCRIPTION
   The class is a decoder for MPEG audio audio streams. The decoding is done
   with mpega.library.

   An object of this class has one input (port 0), which accepts
   MMF_AUDIO_MPEG data type. It has also one output (port 1), which has
   MMFC_AUDIO_INT16 type.

 NEW ATTRIBUTES
   Attributes applicability:
     I - may be set at creation time.
     S - may be set on an existing object.
     G - may be get from an object.
     P - may be set for an object's port.
     Q - may be queried from an object's port.

   MMA_Sound_BitsPerSample   (V51)   [..G.Q], LONG

 NEW METHODS
   MMM_Pull(port, buffer, length)  (V51)
   MMM_Seek(port, type, position)  (V51)

 HISTORY
   51.3   (24.08.2012)
   - If mpegaudio.demuxer provides known stream length, the mpega.library
     decoded output is cut or padded with zeros to match this length exactly.

   51.2   (25.02.2012)
   - MMM_Pull() does not fail on MMERR_END_OF_DATA.

   51.1   (25.08.2009)
   - The first release.
