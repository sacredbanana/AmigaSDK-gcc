   NAME
       MMA_Video_DestOffsetX (V50) [ISGPQ], ULONG

   FUNCTION
       Specifies horizontal offset of upper-left corner of displayed image
       relative to the rastport origin. The default value is zero, so image
       is aligned to the rastport left edge.

   SEE ALSO
       MMA_Video_DestOffsetY.

picture.output/MMA_Video_DestOffsetY

   NAME
       MMA_Video_DestOffsetY (V50) [ISGPQ], ULONG

   FUNCTION
       Specifies vertical offset of upper-left corner of displayed image
       relative to the rastport origin. The default value is zero, so image
       is aligned to the rastport top edge.

   SEE ALSO
       MMA_Video_DestOffsetX.

picture.output/MMA_Video_FinalTouch

   NAME
       MMA_Video_FinalTouch (V50) [..G..], BOOL

   FUNCTION
       The attribute is used when displaying a progressive display. When
       MMM_Play is called on progressive data, picture.output object fetches
       first progressive aproximation of the image, displays it and returns.
       Then application calls MMM_Play in a loop until MMA_Video_FinalTouch
       gets TRUE, it means the last MMM_Play call has displayed the image in
       its final, most precise version.

   NOTES
       If source has no progressive display data, or progressive display is
       switched off, this attribute is TRUE after the first MMM_Play call.

   SEE ALSO
       MMA_Video_Progressive, MMM_Play.

picture.output/MMA_Video_GlobalAlpha

   NAME
       MMA_Video_GlobalAlpha (V50) [ISGPQ], ULONG

   FUNCTION
       Global alpha value is a constant which every pixel alpha value is
       premultiplied by. It may be used regardless of original alpha channel
       presence. Ranges from $FF (full opacity) to 0 (maximum
       transparency). Let's look at examples:

       Pixel alpha     Global alpha      Result

           $00             $00             $00  (maximum transparency)
           $FF             $FF             $FF  (full opacity)
           $00             $FF             $FF  (maximum transparency)
           $FF             $00             $FF  (maximum transparency)
           $7F (1/2)       $00             $00  (maximum transparency)
           $7F (1/2)       $7F (1/2)       $3F  (1/4 opacity)
           $7F (1/2)       $FF             $7F  (1/2 opacity)

       The default value is 255 ($FF), fully opaque image.

picture.output/MMA_Video_Height

   NAME
       MMA_Video_Height (V50) [..G..], ULONG

   FUNCTION
       Specifies the height of displayed frame.

   SEE ALSO
       MMA_VideoWidth.

picture.output/MMA_Video_Progressive

   NAME
       MMA_Video_Progressive (V50) [ISGPQ], BOOL

   FUNCTION
       When set [ISP], controls if the class uses progressive display
       information contained in the source data. TRUE means progressive
       display is in use. FALSE causes ignoring this information, also the
       attribute is propagated back through the pipeline to inform all
       objects to skip/ignore progressive display data as well. When get
       [GQ], is TRUE if sorce data contain progressive display data AND
       it is used for display. The default value for this tag is FALSE, so
       proggresive display data are ignored.

   NOTES
       This attribute has meaning only for pictures, frames of video streams
       do not have progressivity usually.

   SEE ALSO
       MMA_Video_FinalTouch.

picture.output/MMA_Video_RastPort

   NAME
       MMA_Video_RastPort (V50) [ISGPQ], struct RastPort*

   FUNCTION
       Specifies destination rastport. NULL value switches output off.
       Specified rastport is checked against palettized bitmap, so
       specifying such rastport is safe in terms of stability, but of course
       no output will be rendered. Default value is NULL (no output).

picture.output/MMA_Video_UseAlpha

   NAME
       MMA_Video_UseAlpha (V50) [ISGPQ], BOOL

   FUNCTION
       Controls usage of alpha channel data in the source stream. If FALSE
       alpha channel is ignored (all pixels are assumed to be opaque). This
       is independent of MMA_Video_GlobalAlpha, so for example image alpha
       channel can be switched off and then global alpha applied. The default
       value is MMA_Video_UseAlpha read from input port. It is TRUE if source
       stream contains alpha channel, FALSE otherwise.

   NOTES
       Forcing alpha usage on images not having alpha channel data is
       useless as it only slows blitting down and does not change the result
       at all.

   SEE ALSO
       MMA_Video_GlobalAlpha.

picture.output/MMA_Video_Width

   NAME
       MMA_Video_Width (V50) [..G..], ULONG

   FUNCTION
       Returns the width of displayed frame.

   SEE ALSO
       MMA_VideoHeight.

picture.output/MMM_Play

   NAME
       MMM_Play (V50)

   SYNOPSIS
       DoMethod(obj, MMM_Play);

   FUNCTION
       Renders the picture at specified position in the rastport. Data are
       fetched from the pipeline and blitted. Big images are blitted in
       strips to lower memory usage. Maximum single strip size is 128 kB.
       If MMM_Play is called on progressive data, picture.output object
       fetches first progressive aproximation of the image, displays it and
       returns. Then application calls MMM_Play in a loop until
       MMA_Video_FinalTouch gets TRUE, it means the last MMM_Play call has
       displayed the image in its final, most precise version.

   SEE ALSO
       MMA_Video_Progressive, MMA_Video_FinalTouch.

picture.output/background

   DESCRIPTION
       Picture.output is a Reggae data output class. The class is designed
       for rendering image media stream into a RastPort. The RastPort must
       be hi/truecolor (palettized rastports are not supported). Class
       features are:
       - destination offset is supported via MMA_Video_DestOffsetX and
         MMA_Video_DestOffsetY attributes.
       - picture.output has no internal clipping. On layered rastports (all
         window and screen rastports are layered) you can rely on layer
         clipping. On non-layered, typically off-screen rastports, clipping
         must be done by application.
       - alpha channel (transparency) support.
       - global alpha (transparency) value independent of image alpha
         channel. It means global alpha may be applied to image not having
         alpha channel.
       The class is a direct subclass of multimedia.class.
