digibooster3.demuxer/MMA_DataFormat

 NAME
   MMA_DataFormat (V51) [..G.Q], STRPTR

 FUNCTION
   Returns read-only textual NULL-terminated description of decoded format.
   Always "DigiBooster x.y Module", where x.y is version and revision of
   DigiBooster, on which the module has been created.

digibooster3.demuxer/MMA_MediaType

 NAME
   MMA_MediaType (V51) [..G.Q], ULONG

 FUNCTION
   Returns media type of object. All objects of digibooster3.demuxer class
   return MMT_SOUND always.

digibooster3.demuxer/MMA_Sound_BitsPerSample

 NAME
   MMA_Sound_BitsPerSample (V51) [..G.Q], ULONG

 FUNCTION
   Returns number of bits per sample. Always 16.

digibooster3.demuxer/MMA_Sound_Channels

 NAME
   MMA_Sound_Channels (V51) [..G.Q], ULONG

 FUNCTION
   Returns number of audio channels. Always 2.

digibooster3.demuxer/MMA_Sound_FrameCount

 NAME
   MMA_Sound_FrameCount (V51) [..G.Q], UQUAD*

 FUNCTION
   As it is impossible to determine number of audio frames in a song before
   playing it, this attribute has always value 0, meaning unknown number of
   frames.

 NOTES
   This is a 64-bit attribute passed by pointer to UQUAD variable, not by
   value.

digibooster3.demuxer/MMA_Sound_SampleRate

 NAME
   MMA_Sound_SampleRate (V51) [I.G.Q], ULONG

 FUNCTION
   When specified at object creation time, it sets the sampling rate used
   for replayer engine[s]. When queried, returns this rate. The engine
   supports any rate from 8000 to 192000 Hz including.

   The default value of this attribute is 44100 Hz.

digibooster3.demuxer/MMA_Sound_Volume

 NAME
   MMA_Sound_Volume (V50) [IS.PQ], LONG

 FUNCTION
   At object creation time or when set, sets internal volume boost for a
   replayer engines. When set on object, affects all existing engines, when
   set on an output port, affects only engine on this port. Setting on the
   input is ignored. Getting this attribute is possible only on an output
   port.

   Volume boost is scaled in decibels. Allowed range is from -84 to +24 dB,
   both sides including. The default value is 0 dB.

digibooster3.demuxer/MMA_StreamPosFrames

 NAME
   MMA_StreamPosFrames (V51) [....Q], UQUAD*

 FUNCTION
   Returns number of audio frames sent to queried output port.

 NOTES
   This is a 64-bit attribute passed by pointer to UQUAD variable, not by
   value.

digibooster3.demuxer/MMA_StreamPosTime

 NAME
   MMA_StreamPosTime (V51) [....Q], UQUAD*

 FUNCTION
   Returns time position in microseconds from the start of a song on given
   port. Based strictly on MMA_StreamPosFrames and MMA_Sound_SampleRate.

 NOTES
   This is a 64-bit attribute passed by pointer to UQUAD variable, not by
   value.

digibooster3.demuxer/MMM_Pull

 NAME
   MMM_Pull (V51)

 SYNOPSIS
   bytes = DoMethod(obj, MMM_Pull, ULONG port, APTR buffer, ULONG length);

 FUNCTION
   Fetches block of synthesized DigiBooster 3 module audio stream. Block
   length in bytes must be evenly divisible by 4 (size of one stereo 16-bit
   audio frame).

 INPUTS
   - obj, object to perform the method on.
   - port, number of port, must be one of outputs.
   - buffer, a memory buffer for pulled data, must be aligned to 16-byte
     boundary (preferrably allocated with MediaAllocMem()).
   - length, amount of pulled data in bytes.

 RESULT
   - bytes, number of bytes pulled actually. Zero means end of data or
     error, error code is available via MMA_ErrorCode attribute.

digibooster3.demuxer/MMM_Seek

 NAME
   MMM_Seek -- seeks in audio stream.(V51)

 SYNOPSIS
   success = DoMethod(obj, MMM_Seek, ULONG port, ULONG type, QUAD* pos);

 FUNCTION
   The class does not support seeking.

 INPUTS
   - obj, object to perform the method on.
   - port.
   - type, seek type.
   - position, new, absolute byte position in the stream.

 RESULT
   FALSE.

 DESCRIPTION
   The class is a Reggae demultiplexer for DigiBooster 3 music modules.
   Thanks to backward format compatibility it also decodes DigiBooster Pro 2
   modules. The class bases on the official replayer code.

   The whole module is loaded to memory when object's input is connected to
   the source data stream. The input port has number 0. By default an object
   of this class has one output port, port 1. The first song of the module
   is decoded to this port. If a source module has more songs, additional
   outputs are created dynamically after the input is connected. As the
   class decodes the module to MMFC_AUDIO_INT16, no additional decoder
   objects are needed.

   Module playback engine is created for each song when relevant output port
   is being connected to something, is destroyed when the port is
   disconnected. Then typical player applications may connect to one port
   at a time, so only one replayer engine is running. On the other hand it
   is perfectly possible to decode multiple songs simultaneously and for
   example perform crossfading.

   The digibooster3.demuxer class is a direct subclass of multimedia.class.

 NEW ATTRIBUTES
   Attributes applicability:
     I - may be set at creation time.
     S - may be set on an existing object.
     G - may be get from an object.
     P - may be set for an object's port.
     Q - may be queried from an object's port.
