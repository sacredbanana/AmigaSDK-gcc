 DESCRIPTION
   The class is used to save audio data as RIFF WAVE file (integer PCM,
   encoding type 1). It cooperates with audiopcm.encoder, which converts
   audio to choosen PCM format. Then wave.muxer adds WAVE header. The class
   currently can save 8, 16, 24 and 32-bit WAVE files.

   The class supports argument string and GUI configuration. GUI generator
   delivers a cycle gadget for selecting number of bits per sample. Reggae
   saver generator creates wave.muxer object, audiopcm.encoder object,
   connects them and sets selected PCM format for the encoder.

wave.muxer/MMA_Arguments

 NAME
   MMA_Arguments (V51) [I.G.Q], const char*

 FUNCTION
   Specifies configuration of the object, namely sets proper format to the
   input port. The template is "BITS/K/N".
   - BITS - optional numeric argument specifying bits per audio sample.
     Accepted values are 8, 16, 24 and 32. Defaults to 16.
   This attribute can be also read after the object has been configured in
   any of ways. In this case returned string is read-only.

 NOTES
   When specified for constructor, the string must be valid only until the
   constructor returns, so may be a local variable.

wave.muxer/MMM_Pull

 NAME
   MMM_Pull -- Delivers block of WAVE data stream (V51)

 SYNOPSIS
   LONG DoMethod(obj, MMM_Pull, port, buffer, length);

 FUNCTION
   WAVE multiplexer delivers WAVE header and then passes through audio PCM
   data from audiopcm.decoder. After the header is pulled out, requests are
   forwarded from output to input without any processing or data copying.

 INPUTS
   obj - object to pull data from.
   port - only pull on output port (port 1) is allowed
   buffer - destination data buffer. Must be AltiVec aligned.
   length - number of bytes to pull.

 RESULT
   Number of bytes pulled. In case of error, MMA_ErrorCode is set to a code
   received from the previous object in chain.

 NOTES
   As WAVE header length is usually not aligned to 16 bytes, the class cuts
   the first request at header end, without setting the error code. Then the
   first pull forwarded to audiopcm.encoder starts again from the start of
   buffer so is SIMD-aligned. Object connected at output of WAVE multiplexer
   should continue pulling if it receives less than requested but
   MMA_ErrorCode is still zero.

wave.muxer/MMM_Setup

 NAME
   MMM_Setup -- Receives audio parameters, generates WAVE header (V51)

 SYNOPSIS
   BOOL DoMethod(obj, MMM_Setup, port);

 FUNCTION
   When object's input is connected to data source, the method reads audio
   stream parameters and prepares WAVE header. The data source must provide
   following stream parameters:
   - MMA_Sound_Channels
   - MMA_Sound_SampleRate
   - MMA_Sound_FrameCount

   The method is a no-op for the output port.

 INPUTS
   port - number of port being connected.

 RESULT
   Boolean value of success.

 NOTES
   Data source must be of known length. As the stream length is stored in
   the WAVE header, free streaming is not supported with this format. This
   method fails if reported stream length is 0 frames (unknown).

wave.muxer/OM_DISPOSE

 NAME
   OM_DISPOSE -- Disposes WAVE multiplexer object (V51)

 SYNOPSIS
   DisposeObject(obj);

 FUNCTION
   Disposes object, frees allocated memory.

wave.muxer/OM_NEW

 NAME
   OM_NEW -- Creates Reggae WAVE multiplexer (V51)

 SYNOPSIS
   obj = NewObject(NULL, "wave.muxer", ...);

 FUNCTION
   Creates a WAVE multiplexer object. By default the object is set up to
   generate 16-bit file.

 INPUTS
   Following attributes may be specified:
   - MMA_Arguments - configures input port format and determines number of
     bits per sample in output. Optional.
   - MMA_ErrorCode - pointer to LONG variable, where error code (or 0 in
     case of success) is stored. Optional.

 RESULT
   Created object, or NULL. In case of failure MMA_ErrorCode specifies
   reason:
   - MMERR_OUT_OF_MEMORY, no free memory,
   - MMERR_WRONG_ARGUMENTS, malformed MMA_Arguments, or unsupported number
     of bits per sample specified.
