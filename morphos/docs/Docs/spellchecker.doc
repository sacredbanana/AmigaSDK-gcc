   spellchecker.library is a MorphOS shared library providing a
   straighforward API for checking a word against a dictionary.

   The library was rewritten for MorphOS 3.12 to use a hunspell
   based backend.

spellchecker.library/CloseDictionary

   NAME
   CloseDictionary -- Releases all allocated resources

   SYNOPSIS
   CloseDictionary(struct SpellChecker*);

   FUNCTION
   Releases allocated resources for dictionary.

   INPUTS
   A pointer to a SpellChecker structure obtained from OpenDictionary.

   RESULT
   Nothing.

   SEE ALSO
   OpenDictionary()

spellchecker.library/Learn

   NAME
   Learn -- Add a word to user dictionary

   SYNOPSIS
   BOOL Learn(struct SpellChecker *sp, STRPTR word);

   FUNCTION
   Adds a word to user dictionary described by pointer to SpellChecker structure.

   INPUTS
   A pointer to a null terminated string to be added to user dictionary.
   No checking for duplicated word is made. User dictionary must be a list
   of plain text words separated by new line character. It must not be
   compressed by any means.

   RESULT
   If word is added to user dictionary file, returns TRUE otherwise returns
   FALSE.

   NAME
   LIB_ListDictionaries -- Lists available languages in a displayable format

   SYNOPSIS
   APTR LIB_ListDictionaries(struct SpellChecker *sp, void *buffer, LONG bufferSize);

   FUNCTION
   Returns a NULL terminated list of strings containing language names in
   displayable form. They'll either be encoded in ISO_8859_1 or UTF8. Those names
   may be passed to OpenDictionary via SCA_Name.

   INPUTS
   Pointer to a memory block to use to build the output list at.

   TAGS
   SCA_UTF8 - set to TRUE to return UTF-8 encoded strings
   SCA_Default - STRPTR *, if non NULL, will be poked an address to a string with the default
                 dictionary name

   RESULT
   NULL terminated list of languages

   SEE ALSO
spellchecker.library/OpenDictionary

   NAME
   OpenDictionary -- Opens a dictionary

   SYNOPSIS
   struct SpellChecker* = OpenDictionary(STRPTR filename, struct TagItem* tagitem);

   FUNCTION
   Opens a dictionary file and returns a private SpellChecker structure
   that describes the opened dictionary.

   INPUTS
   filename, string pointer to a dictionary name. dictionary can be loaded
   from any path. Dictionnaries should be stored in the default system layout:
   LOCALE:Dictionnaries/<language>.
   Default dictionary filename is 'base.dic'.
   If filename argument is NULL, default language dictionary will be loaded from
   default system dictionary naming scheme: LOCALE:Dictionnaries/<language>/base.dic
   tagitem argument is a pointer to a null terminated array of tags.

   TAGS
   SCA_UTF8 (BOOL) - input/output strings of Suggest/SpellCheck/Learn are assumed
                     to be UTF8 encoded. Defaults to FALSE for legacy compatibility
                     but you should always set this to TRUE and use UTF8
   SCA_Name (CONST_STRPTR) - disregard filename and use passed in language name.
                       Name must have been passed from ListDictionaries


   RESULT
   Returns a private pointer to SpellChecker structure

   If dictionary opening fails, function call returns NULL.

spellchecker.library/SpellCheck

   NAME
   SpellCheck -- checks for a word against a dictionary.

   SYNOPSIS
   BOOL SpellCheck(struct SpellChecker *sp, STRPTR word, struct TagItem *items)

   FUNCTION
   Checks word argument against the provided dictionary. The string must be
   encoded in UTF-8 (recommended) or in dictionary's codepage (legacy), depending
   on how the dictionary was opened.

   INPUTS
   sp - a pointer to a SpellChecker structure obtained from
   OpenDictionary.
   word - a pointer to a null terminated string.
   items - spell check options as a tag item list.

   TAGS
   None currently.

   RESULT
   Returns TRUE if the word is found in dictionary.

   SEE ALSO

spellchecker.library/Suggest

   NAME
   Suggest -- checks for a word against a dictionary.

   SYNOPSIS
   APTR Suggest(struct SpellChecker *sp, STRPTR word, struct TagItem *items)

   FUNCTION
   Checks word argument against the provided dictionary. The string must be
   encoded in UTF-8 (recommended) or in system's codepage (legacy), depending
   on how the dictionary was opened.

   INPUTS
   sp - a pointer to a SpellChecker structure obtained from
   OpenDictionary.
   word - a pointer to a null terminated string.
   items - suggestion options as a tag item list.

   TAGS

   RESULT
   Suggest returns -1 if the word is found in dictionary.
   Suggest returns an array of up to 63 suggested words if
   suitable words has been found. The array is null terminated.
   If no suitable word has been found, Suggest returns NULL.

   NOTES
   The call is not thread safe when called with the same dictionary handle!
