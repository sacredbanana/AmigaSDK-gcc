    NAME
	MUIA_Process_AutoLaunch -- (V20) [I..], ULONG, 0x80428855

   FUNCTION
	If set to TRUE process loop is started right after object
	instance is created. Defaults to TRUE.

Process.mui/MUIA_Process_Priority

    NAME
	MUIA_Process_Priority -- (V20) [I..], ULONG, 0x80422a54

   FUNCTION
	Specifies a priority for the process. Defaults to the same priority
	as the calling process and shouldn't be changed if not needed.

Process.mui/MUIA_Process_SourceClass

    NAME
	MUIA_Process_SourceClass -- (V20) [I..], ULONG, 0x8042cf8b

   FUNCTION
	To make it possible to 'embedd' process class instance into custom class
	this attribute should point to the container class. MUIM_Process_Process
	method will be called using class given with this attribute and an object
	specified with MUIA_Process_SourceObject.

    SYNOPSIS
	DoMethod(obj,MUIM_Process_Kill,LONG maxdelay);

   FUNCTION
	Stops process' loop (MUIM_Process_Process). If the loop
	is not running does nothing.

   FUNCTION
	Starts process' loop (MUIM_Process_Process). If the loop
	is already running does nothing.

    SYNOPSIS
	DoMethod(obj,MUIM_Process_Process,ULONG *kill, Boopsiobject *proc);

   FUNCTION
	Main process method. Terminating condition is passed in message struct.
	Proper implementation should wait for a signal to not use 100% cpu.
