	The balance class is very simple and has no attributes.
	Inserting objects of this class somewhere in your
	group (only horizontal or vertical groups, nothing
	2-dimensional) allows your users to dynamically change
	the weight of your children.

	Starting from MorphOS 3.10 the balance class is capable to
	save the weight of children.
