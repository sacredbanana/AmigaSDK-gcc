   DESCRIPTION
  With this class you can create automatically scrolling text to
  your program. It is useful in about requesters and other informational
  boxes, like in MUI custom classes. Listtree.mcc uses Crawling.mcc
  on its preferences module to display credits.

    The original Crawling.mcc was written by Klaus 'kmel' Melchior.

   EXAMPLE

    #include <mui/Crawling_mcc.h>

    STATIC CONST TEXT info[] = "Crawling example text";
    STATIC CONST TEXT more[] = "This is an example.";
