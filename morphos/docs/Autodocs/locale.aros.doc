   NAME
    CloseCatalog -- 

   SYNOPSIS
    CloseCatalog(catalog)
    void CloseCatalog(struct Catalog *);

   FUNCTION
        Conclude access to a message catalog, and decrement the use count.
        If this use count is 0, the catalog can be expunged when the
        system memory is running low.

   INPUTS
        catalog - the message catalog to close, note that NULL is
                  a valid catalog.

   RESULT
        The catalog is closed, and should no longer be used by the
        application.

        to a user specified callback function.

   INPUTS

        locale        --  the locale to use when formatting the string
        formatString  --  the formatting template string; this is much like the
                          printf() formatting style, i.e. a % followed by a

                    %n -- linefeed
                    %p -- AM or PM string
                    %P -- am or pm string
                    %q -- hour using 24 hour style
                    %Q -- hour using 12 hour style

                    %S -- the number of seconds with leading zeros
                    %t -- tab
                    %T -- the same as "%H:%M:%S"
                    %U -- the week number, taking Sunday as the first day
                          of the week
                    %w -- the weekday number
                    %W -- the week number, taking Monday as the first day
                          of the week
                    %x -- the same as "%m/%d/%y"
                    %X -- the same as "%H:%M:%S"
                    %y -- the year using two digits with leading zeros
                    %Y -- the year using four digits with leading zeros

        If the template parameter is NULL, a single null byte
        is sent to the callback function.

        date          --  the current date
        hook          --  callback function; this is called for every character
                          generated with the following arguments:

                          * pointer to hook structure
                          * character
                          * pointer to locale

   SYNOPSIS
    GetCatalogStr(catalog, stringNum, )
    STRPTR GetCatalogStr(struct Catalog *, ULONG, CONST);

   FUNCTION
        This function will return the string specified by the
        stringNum from the given message catalog, or the defaultString
        if the string could not be found.

        If the catalog == NULL, then the defaultString will also be

        stringNum     - ID of the string to find.
        defaultString - String to return in case catalog is NULL or
                        string could not be found.

   RESULT
        A pointer to a READ ONLY NULL terminated string. This string
        pointer is valid as long as the catalog remains open.

   NAME
    GetLocaleStr -- 

   SYNOPSIS
    GetLocaleStr(locale, stringNum)
    STRPTR GetLocaleStr(struct Locale *, ULONG);

   FUNCTION
        This function will return a system standard string from
        the current Locale.

   INPUTS
        locale      - The current locale.
        stringNum   - The number of the string to get a pointer to.
                      See the include file <libraries/locale.h>
                      for a list of possible values.

   RESULT
        A pointer to a NULL-terminated string, or NULL if the string
        requested was unknown. The returned string is READ-ONLY and
        is valid only as long as the Locale remains open.

locale.library/OpenCatalogA

   NAME
    OpenCatalogA -- 

   SYNOPSIS
    OpenCatalogA(locale, name, tags)
    struct Catalog * OpenCatalogA(struct Locale*, STRPTR, struct TagItem *);

   FUNCTION
        Open a catalog for translated strings.

   INPUTS
        locale - desired language for the catalog or NULL to use
                 user defined default.
        name   - catalog name to open
        tags   - optional taglist

        OC_BuiltInStrings (V52.4 / MorphOS 3.10)
           Pointer to built-in strings. When translation is not available
           built-in string is used. This allows using NULL string argument
           with GetCatalogStr().

locale.library/OpenLocale

   NAME
    OpenLocale -- 

   SYNOPSIS
    OpenLocale(name)
    struct Locale * OpenLocale(STRPTR);

   FUNCTION
        This function will open for use a named locale. A locale is a
        data structure that contains many different parameters that
        an application needs in order to localise itself. Using this
        information an application can dynamically adapt to the user's
        environment.

        Locales are created using the Locale Preferences Editor. If
        you pass a NULL instead of a name, then you will receive the
        current default Locale. This is the normal procedure.

   INPUTS
        name - The name of the locale you wish opened, or NULL
               to open the current default locale. This will
               be an IFF PREF file which contains both LCLE
               and CTRY chunks.

   RESULT
        A pointer to an initialised Locale structure, or NULL if none
        could be opened. If NULL is returned you can use IoErr()
        to find out what caused this error.

        If you pass NULL, you will always succeed.

locale.library/ParseDate
        ParseDate --

   FUNCTION
        This function will convert a stream of characters into an AmigaDOS
        DateStamp structure. It will obtain its characters from the
        getCharFunc callback hook, and the given formatting template will
        be used to direct the parse.

   INPUTS
        locale      -   the locale to use for the formatting

        date        -   where to put the converted date. If this is NULL,
                        then this function can be used to verify a date
                        string.

        fmtTemplate -   the date template used to direct the parse of the
                        data. The following FormatDate() formatting
                        controls can be used:
                        %a %A %b %B %d %e %h %H %I %m %M %p %S %y %Y

                        See FormatDate() autodoc for more information.

        getCharFunc -   A callback Hook which is used to read the data
                        from a stream. The hook is called with:

                        A0 - address of the Hook structure
                        A2 - locale pointer
                        A1 - NULL

                        BTW: The AmigaOS autodocs which state that A1
                             gets locale pointer and A2 NULL are wrong!!

                        The read character should be returned in D0. Note
                        that this is a 32 bit character not an 8 bit
                        character. Return a NULL character if you reach the
                        end of the stream.

   RESULT
        TRUE    -   If the parse could be performed.
        FALSE   -   If the format of the data did not match the formatting
                    string.

   NOTES
        This has a few differences from the implementation in locale.library
        v38. In particular:

        - %p does not have to be at the end of the line.
        - %d and %e are not effectively the same, ie %d requires a leading
          zero, but %e can not handle leading 0's.

   EXAMPLE

   BUGS
        %d, %e probably needs some work.

   NAME
    RexxHost -- 

   SYNOPSIS
    RexxHost(rxmsg)
    ULONG RexxHost(struct RexxMsg *);

   FUNCTION
        locale.library rexxhost interface (located at offset -30), provides the
        following Locale functions to ARexx scripts:

        OpenCatalog(CATALOGNAME/A,BUILTINLANGUAGE/A,VERSION/N/A)
        CloseCatalog(CATALOG/N/A)
        GetCatalogStr(CATALOG/N/A,STRINGNUM/N/A,DEFAULTSTR/A)
        GetLocaleStr(STRINGNUM/N/A)   (V50)
        ConvToLower(CHARACTER/A)
        ConvToUpper(CHARACTER/A)
        StrnCmp(STRING1/A,STRING2/A,TYPE/N/A)
        IsXXXX(CHARACTER/A)

   EXAMPLE
        if ~show('L', 'locale.library') then
        do
            call addlib('locale.library', 0, -30, 50)
        end

        catalog = OpenCatalog('myapp.catalog', 'english', 0)
        say GetCatalogStr(catalog, 1, 'default')
        call CloseCatalog(catalog)

locale.library/StrConvert

   NAME
    StrConvert -- 

   SYNOPSIS
    StrConvert(locale, string, buffer, bufferSize, type)
    ULONG StrConvert(struct Locale *, STRPTR, APTR, ULONG, ULONG);

   FUNCTION
        This function will transform the string given and place the
        result in the supplied buffers, copying at most bufferSize
        bytes.

        The transformation is such that if the C strcmp() function
        was called on two strings transformed by this function then
        the result will be the same as calling the Locale StrnCmp()
        function on the two strings.

   INPUTS
        locale      -   the Locale to use for the transformation.
        string      -   the string to be transformed
        buffer      -   the destination for the transformed string.
                        This buffer may need to be larger than the
                        untransformed string.
        bufferSize  -   the maximum number of bytes to place in
                        buffer.
        type        -   how to transform the string. See the
                        StrnCmp() function for possible values.

   RESULT
        Length of the number of BYTES placed in the buffer by
        the transformation process minus 1 (for NULL termination).

   SEE ALSO
        StrnCmp()

locale.library/StrnCmp

   NAME
    StrnCmp -- 

   SYNOPSIS
    StrnCmp(locale, string, string, length, type)
    LONG StrnCmp(struct Locale *, STRPTR, STRPTR, LONG, ULONG);

   FUNCTION
        StrnCmp() will compare two strings, up to a maximum length
        of length using a specific kind of collation information
        according to the locale.

        The result will be less than zero, zero, or greater than zero
        depending upon whether the string string1 is less than, equal
        to, or greater than the string pointed to string2.

   INPUTS
        locale      -   Which locale to use for this comparison.
        string1     -   NULL terminated string.
        string2     -   NULL terminated string.
        length      -   Maximum length of string to compare.
        type        -   How to compare the strings, values are:

        SC_ASCII
            Perform a simple ASCII case-insensitive comparison.
            This is the fastest comparison, but considers that
            accented characters are different to non-accented
            characters.

        SC_COLLATE1
            This sorts using the "primary sorting order". This
            means that characters such as 'e' and 'é' will be
            considered the same. This method also ignores
            case.

        SC_COLLATE2
            This will sort using both the primary and secondary
            sorting order. This is the slowest sorting method
            and should be used when presenting data to a user.

            The first pass is the same as SC_COLLATE1, meaning
            that two strings such as "role" and "rôle" would
            be sorted identically. The second pass will
            compare the diacritical marks.

   RESULT
        The relationship between the two strings.

        < 0 means   string1 <  string2
        = 0 means   string1 == string2
        > 0 means   string1 >  string2
