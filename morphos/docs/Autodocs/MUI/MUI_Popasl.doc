	As a subclass of popstring class, popasl can be used to pop up
	any kinds of standard system asl requesters. A seperate task is
	spawned to handle these requesters, the application continues to
	run.

	Using an asl popup class, you don't need to worry about handling
	asl requesters. MUI will automatically open one when the popup
	button is pressed and update the corresponding string gadget
    when the user terminates the requester. From the programmers
	point of view, all you have to do is to handle the string
	gadgets contents.

	IMPORTANT: At object creation time, you can use all ASL library 
	tags as well. They will be passed to the AllocAslRequest() call 
	without further interpretation, but some of the tags may get
	overloaded by Popasl's normal requester opening procedure - namely
	ASLFR_InitialFile and ASLFR_InitialDrawer. These can be changed
	by using MUIA_Popasl_StartHook.
Popasl.mui/MUIA_Popasl_Active

    NAME
	MUIA_Popasl_Active -- (V7 ) [..G], BOOL, 0x80421b37

    FUNCTION
	Popasl creates asynchronous popups. Requesters are opened in a
	seperately spawned task and don't disturb the rest of the
	application. You can ask for the state of a requester by
	querying the MUIA_Popasl_Active attribute. It will return
	TRUE when the requester is currently open, FALSE otherwise.

	Common use for this attribute is to prevent an application
	from being terminated while a requester is open. If you
	try to dispose the popasl object with a currently open
	requester, MUI will freeze your task as long as the requester
	stays there.

    EXAMPLE
	case MUIV_Application_ReturnID_Quit:
	{
	   LONG active;

	   get(pop1,MUIA_Popasl_Active,&active);
	   if (!active) get(pop2,MUIA_Popasl_Active,&active);
	   if (!active) get(pop3,MUIA_Popasl_Active,&active);
	   if (!active) get(pop4,MUIA_Popasl_Active,&active);

	   if (active)
	      MUI_Request(app,window,0,NULL,"OK",
	                  "Cannot quit now, still some asl popups opened.");
	   else
	      running = FALSE;
	}
	break;

    NAME
	MUIA_Popasl_MUIFontStyles -- (V22) [ISG], BOOL, 0x8042897f

    FUNCTION
	When set to TRUE, enables the outline, glow and other effects and colors
	configuration in the popup requester. Defaults to FALSE

Popasl.mui/MUIA_Popasl_StartHook

    NAME
	MUIA_Popasl_StartHook -- (V7 ) [ISG], struct Hook *, 0x8042b703

    FUNCTION
	Before popasl class opens the asl requester, it has to
	get some kind of parameters describing its initial contents.
	A file popup would e.g. need to split the string gadgets
	contents into path and file name part and pass these
	as ASLFR_InititalFile and ASLFR_InitialDrawer to the
	requester.

	The MUIA_Popasl_StartHook tag describes a hook function
	that will be called immediately before the requester is
	opened. It will receive a pointer to itself in A0,
	a pointer to the popasl object in A2 and a pointer to
	a taglist in A1. This taglist already contains some
	tags:

	ASLFR/FO/..._Screen          : parent screen
	ASLFR/FO/..._PrivateIDCMP    : TRUE
	ASLFR/FO/..._InititalLeftEdge: left edge of popasl object
	ASLFR/FO/..._InititalTopEdge : bottom edge of popasl object
	ASLFR/FO/..._InititalWidth   : width of popasl object, only
	                               present when the popup is called
	                               for the first time.

	You may add other tags to the list, but beware that the
	maximum allowed number of tags is 15. If you need more,
	use the TAG_MORE tag.

	Since the asl requester will run in a seperate task, you should
	not change the state of the ASLFR_PrivateIDCMP tag!

	If your hook returns TRUE, popasl class opens the requester
	with the given taglist. A return value of FALSE should be
	used when something went wrong, no requester will be opened
	in this case.

	For file and font requester, popasl class will fall back to a
	default tag handling when no start hook is specified. A file
	name is automatically split into path and file part and passed
	to the requester a ASLFR_InitialFile and ASLFR_InitialDrawer.
	A font requester splits a string like "topaz/8" into 
	font name and size for ASLFO_InitialName and ASLFO_InitialSize.

Popasl.mui/MUIA_Popasl_StopHook

    NAME
	MUIA_Popasl_StopHook -- (V7 ) [ISG], struct Hook *, 0x8042d8d2

    FUNCTION
	When the requester terminates, MUIA_Popasl_StopHook will be
	called with a pointer to itself in A0, a pointer to the
	popasl object in A2 and a pointer to the asl requester
	structure in A1. The hook can then parse the requester 
	structure and set the string gadgets contents respectively.

	For file and font requesters, a default handling is provided.

Popasl.mui/MUIA_Popasl_Type

    NAME
	MUIA_Popasl_Type -- (V7 ) [I.G], ULONG, 0x8042df3d

    FUNCTION
	This tag allows to set the type of asl requester. Pass
	the same value you would use for AllocAslRequest(), e.g.
	ASL_FileRequest, ASL_FontRequest or ASL_ScreenModeRequest.

	For ASL_FileRequest and ASL_FontRequest, popasl class offers a
	a standard start/stop handling. When a file requester is opened,
	MUI splits the string gadgets contents into a path and a file
	name and uses these as initial paremeters for the requester.
	Font popups translate a font into a name/size pair, e.g.
	"topaz/8". You can override these translations by specifying
	a MUIA_Popasl_StartHook and a MUIA_Popasl_StopHook.

	For ASL_ScreenModeRequest, no standard handling is available.
	Using such a popup without Start and Stop hooks won't make
	much sense.
