	Image class is used to display one of MUI's standard
	images or some selfmade image data.

    NAME
	MUIA_Image_BuiltinSpec -- (V21) [ISG], ULONG, 0x8042b907

    FUNCTION

Image.mui/MUIA_Image_FontMatch

    NAME
	MUIA_Image_FontMatch -- (V4 ) [I..], BOOL, 0x8042815d

    FUNCTION
	If TRUE, width and height of the given image will be 
	scaled to match the current font. Images are always 
	defined with a reference font of topaz/8, bigger fonts 
	will make the image grow (as long as its maximum size
	is big enough).

    EXAMPLE
	The arrows of a scroll bar are e.g. defined with
	MUIA_Image_FontMatch.

    NAME
	MUIA_Image_FontMatchHeight -- (V4 ) [I..], BOOL, 0x80429f26

    FUNCTION
	If TRUE, the height of the given image will be scaled
	to match the current font. Images are always defined
	with a reference font of topaz/8, bigger fonts will
	make the image grow (as long as its maximum size
	is big enough).

    NAME
	MUIA_Image_FontMatchWidth -- (V4 ) [I..], BOOL, 0x804239bf

    FUNCTION
	If TRUE, the width of the given image will be scaled
	to match the current font. Images are always defined
	with a reference font of topaz/8, bigger fonts will
	make the image grow (as long as its maximum size
	is big enough).

Image.mui/MUIA_Image_FreeHoriz

    NAME
	MUIA_Image_FreeHoriz -- (V4 ) [I..], BOOL, 0x8042da84

    FUNCTION
	Tell the image if its allowed to get scaled horizontally.
	Defaults to FALSE.

Image.mui/MUIA_Image_FreeVert

    NAME
	MUIA_Image_FreeVert -- (V4 ) [I..], BOOL, 0x8042ea28

    FUNCTION
	Tell the image if its allowed to get scaled vertically.
	Defaults to FALSE.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Image_FreeHoriz, MUIA_Image_FontMatch
Image.mui/MUIA_Image_OldImage

    NAME
	MUIA_Image_OldImage -- (V4 ) [I..], struct Image *, 0x80424f3d

    FUNCTION
	Allows you to use any conventional image structure
	within a MUI window. The resulting object is always
	as big as the image and not resizable.
Image.mui/MUIA_Image_Spec

    NAME
	MUIA_Image_Spec -- (V4 ) [ISG], STRPTR, 0x804233d5

    FUNCTION
	Specify the type of your image. Usually, you will
	use one of the predefined standard images here,
	(one of the MUII_xxx definitions from mui.h),
	but you also can supply a string containing
        a MUI image specification. Image specifications
	always starts with a digit, followed by a ':', 
	followed by some parameters. Currently, the
	following things are defined (all numeric
	parameters need to be ascii values!):

	"0:<x>" where <x> is between MUII_BACKGROUND and
	        MUII_FILLBACK2 identifying a builtin pattern.

	"1:<x>" where <x> identifies a builtin standard image.
	        Don't use this, use "6:<x>" instead.

	"2:<r>,<g>,<b>" where <r>, <g> and <b> are 32-bit RGB
	                color values specified as 8-digit hex
	                string (e.g. 00000000 or ffffffff).
	                Kick 2.x users will get an empty image.

	"3:<n>" where <n> is the name of an external boopsi
	        image class.

	"4:<n>" where <n> is the name of an external MUI brush.

	"5:<n>" where <n> is the name of an external picture
	        file that should be loaded with datatypes.
	        Kick 2.x users will get an empty image.

	"6:<x>" where <x> is between MUII_WindowBack and
	        MUII_Count-1 identifying a preconfigured
	        image/background.

Image.mui/MUIA_Image_State

    NAME
	MUIA_Image_State -- (V4 ) [IS.], LONG, 0x8042a3ad

    FUNCTION
	Some MUI images offer different states, you can select
	one of the by setting this attribute. Simply use
	one of the IDS_NORMAL, IDS_SELECTED, ... values
	defined in "intuition/imageclass.h".

	Note: Objects that respond to user input will
	      automatically toggle their state between
	      IDS_NORMAL to IDS_SELECTED depending on
	      their MUIA_Selected attribute.
