	Family class is the base class for objects that are able
	to handle a list of children. This is e.g. the case for
	MUIs Menustrip, Menu and Menuitem objects.

	Family class defines methods and attributes to
	add and remove children, sort children, and transfer
	children to other Family objects.

	Group class and application class should also be a
	subclass of Family class, but due to BOOPSI system
	limitations, this is currently impossible. If the
	future will allow more logical class trees, things
	might change, but everything will be done in a
	compatible manner.
Family.mui/MUIA_Family_Child

    NAME
	MUIA_Family_Child -- (V8 ) [I..], Boopsiobject *, 0x8042c696

    FUNCTION
	You supply a pointer to a previously created MUI object
	here. This object will be added to family at family
	creation time.

	Of course you can specify any number of child objects,
	limited only by available memory.

	Normally, the value for a MUIA_Family_Child tag is
	a direct call to another MUI_NewObject(), children
	are generated "on the fly".

	When a family is disposed, all of its children will also
	get deleted. If you supply a NULL pointer as child,
	the family object will fail and previously dispose all
	valid children found in the taglist.

	This behaviour makes it possible to generate a complete
	family within one single (but long) MUI_NewObject()
	call. Error checking is not necessary since every error,
	even if it occurs in a very deep nesting level, will
	cause the complete call to fail without leaving back
	any previously created object.

    NOTES
	As a special case, MUIA_Group_Child is also recognized
	and treated as MUIA_Family_Child.

    SYNOPSIS
	DoMethod(obj,MUIM_Family_Insert,Boopsiobject *obj, Boopsiobject *pred);

    FUNCTION
	Add an object after another object to the family.
	Subclasses of family class usually define which
	types of objects are possible within their family.

    INPUTS
	obj  - the object to be added.
	pred - the new object is inserted *after* this
	       object. pred must of course be a member
	       of the family.
