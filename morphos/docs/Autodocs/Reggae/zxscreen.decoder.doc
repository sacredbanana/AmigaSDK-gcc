 NAME
   MMA_Video_UseAlpha (V50) [..G.Q], BOOL

 FUNCTION
   Returns FALSE always, as ZX Spectrum screen dumps have no transparency.

zxscreen.decoder/MMM_Pull

 NAME
   MMM_Pull -- Writes common format image data to specified buffer. (V50)

 SYNOPSIS
   ULONG DoMethod(Object *obj, MMM_Pull, ULONG port, APTR buffer, ULONG
   length);

 FUNCTION
   The function decodes amount of scanlines needed to satisfy the request
   and places decoder ARGB32 data in a specified buffer.

 INPUTS
   obj - object to perform method on.
   port - number of port, data must be pulled from output, so 1.
   buffer - destination buffer for common format image data. This buffer
     must be allocated with MediaAllocMem().
   length - amount of data to be pulled in bytes. It should be evenly
     divisible by number of bytes per pixel for the common format (4 for
     MMFC_VIDEO_ARGB32), if not, it is rounded down, and the rest of bytes
     are undefined.

 RESULT
   Number of bytes pulled, secondary error information via MMA_ErrorCode.

 DESCRIPTION
   This class is a decoder for ZX Spectrum screen dumps (SCR format). It
   deinterleaves pixel bitmap, then applies attributes to 8 x 8 squares to
   get ARGB data using palette delivered by zxscreen.demuxer. The whole
   source data are buffered (6912 bytes) plus one decoded scanline (1024
   bytes).

 NEW ATTRIBUTES
   Attributes applicability:
     I - may be set at creation time.
     S - may be set on an existing object.
     G - may be get from an object.
     P - may be set for an object's port.
     Q - may be queried from an object's port.

 NEW METHODS
   MMM_Pull(port, buffer, length)  (V50)

 HISTORY
   51.3  (19.06.2009)
   - Uses MMM_PREPULL_NOT_DONE when checking MMM_PrePull() return value.
   - Added requirement of multimedia.class 52.15.

   51.2  (27.05.2009)
   - MMM_Pull() now uses MMM_PrePull() and MMM_PostPull() for simplicity.
   - Added requirement of multimedia.class 52.13+.

   51.1  (07.08.2007)
   - Initial revision.
