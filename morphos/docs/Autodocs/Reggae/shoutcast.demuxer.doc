 NAME
   MMA_Shoutcast_DataGap [I.G.Q], LONG,

 FUNCTION
   Data gap in bytes between two Shoutcast metadata frames in the audio
   stream. Data gap value is sent by a Shoutcast server in header of its
   HTTP response. Then application has to get it from http.stream object and
   specify it in the constructor of shoutcast.demuxer. It should be done in
   the following sequence:
     1. Application creates http.stream object, which connects to a
        Shoutcast server.
     2. After connection is estabilished and response header received,
        application gets data gap value with MMM_Http_GetHeaderEntry() using
        "icy-metaint" entry name and converts it to an integer.
     3. Application creates shoutcast.demuxer object specifying data gap in
        NewObject().
   If there is no "icy-metaint" field in the response header, it means the
   server sends pure audio stream without metadata. Then shoutcast.demuxer
   object should not be added to the processing chain, stream objects
   should be connected to matching audio demuxer directly.

shoutcast.demuxer/MMM_Pull

 NAME
   MMM_Pull -- pulls block of data from output port. (V51)

 SYNOPSIS
   LONG DoMethod(obj, MMM_Pull, LONG port, APTR buffer, LONG length);

 FUNCTION
   Delivers a block of audio encoded stream, stripped off Shoutcast metadata
   frames. Evevy complete Shoutcast frame encountered is parsed and
   submitted to Reggae metadata engine. Audio data are not processed.

 INPUTS
   - port - port number.
   - buffer - buffer for pulled data, allocated with MediaAllocVec().
   - length - length of requested data block in bytes.

 RESULT
   Number of bytes stored in the buffer. Additional error information
   available via MMA_ErrorCode.

shoutcast.demuxer/MMM_Seek

 NAME
   MMM_Seek -- moves read pointer in the buferred stream. (V51)

 SYNOPSIS
   BOOL DoMethod(obj, MMM_Seek, LONG port, LONG type, QUAD *position);

 FUNCTION
   Shoutcast protocol does not support seeking, so this method always return
   FALSE.

 INPUTS
   - port - port number.
   - type - only MMM_SEEK_BYTES allowed.
   - position - new absolute position in stream (pointer to 64-bit variable).

 RESULT
   Always FALSE.

shoutcast.demuxer/background

 DESCRIPTION
   The class extracts Shoutcast metadata frames from compressed audio
   stream. Shoutcast frames are then removed from the stream, which is
   passed to the output. Extracted metadata are then parsed and submitted
   to Reggae metadata subsystem.

   Note that shoutcast.demuxer object is not seekable. This is for three
   reasons:
   1. Shoutcast protocol has no seek ability, as it is designed for
      continuous media.
   2. shoutcast.demuxer usually cooperates with http.stream, which is not
      seekable as well.

 HISTORY
   51.2 (13.12.2015)
   - Parses and submits stream title.

   51.1 (22.02.2012)
   - The first release.
