 DESCRIPTION
   This is a Reggae filter used for importing raw video data in several
   formats into Reggae. The filter does not process data, it is only used to
   attach format tag to raw data stream pulled from a stream object. It is
   also used to specify basic video parameters like image width and height
   and framerate. The filter accepts MMF_STREAM format on its input, it
   means that a stream object should be the source of data. It can be for
   example memory stream to fetch data from a memory buffer, or file.stream
   to load raw data from disk. The real format of data is specified by
   setting MMA_Port_Format attribute for the output port. When no format is
   set, the default one is MMFC_VIDEO_ARGB32. Then image dimensions and the
   framerate is set with object's attributes (see below). The output
   format may be one of common video formats of Reggae, or one of encoded
   formats. If it is an encoded format, a decoder is usually connected to
   the object's output. An rawvideo.filter object will allow for following
   output formats:

   Common formats:
   - MMFC_VIDEO_ARGB32
   - MMFC_VIDEO_CMYK32
   - MMFC_VIDEO_GRAY8

   Encoded formats:
   - MMF_VIDEO_GRAY8,
   - MMF_VIDEO_GRAY16BE,
   - MMF_VIDEO_RGB24,
   - MMF_VIDEO_RGB48BE,
   - MMF_VIDEO_LUT8
    - MMF_VIDEO_ARGB32

rawvideo.filter/MMA_StreamPosFrames

 NAME
   MMA_StreamPosFrames (V51) [..G.Q], QUAD

 FUNCTION
   Returns number of complete frames pulled from the output port. If current
   pull pointer is not exactly at frame boundary, the last, partially
   fetched frame is not counted. Value of this attribute is changed by
   MMM_Seek().

rawvideo.filter/MMA_StreamPosTime

 NAME
   MMA_StreamPosTime (V51) [..G.Q], QUAD

 FUNCTION
   Returns current time position in the stream. It is strictly based on
   MMA_StreamPosFrames and framerate specified with MMA_Video_FpsNumerator
   and MMA_Video_FpsDenominator. Any partially fetched frame is ignored in
   calculation. Value of this attribute is changed by MMM_Seek().

rawvideo.filter/MMA_Video_FpsDenominator

 NAME
   MMA_Video_FpsDenominator (V51) [I.G.Q], LONG

 FUNCTION
   This attribute together with MMA_Video_FpsNumerator, specifies the
   frame rate of a video stream as a rational number. The default value of
   this tag is 1, which with MMA_Video_FpsNumerator default value of 25
   means 25 frames per second. Maximum allowed value for this attribute is
   1 000 000. Zero and negative values are rejected.

rawvideo.filter/MMA_Video_FpsNumerator

 NAME
   MMA_Video_FpsNumerator (V51) [I.G.Q], LONG

 FUNCTION
   This attribute together with MMA_Video_FpsDenominator, specifies the
   frame rate of a video stream as a rational number. The default value of
   this tag is 25, which with MMA_Video_FpsDenominator default value of 1
   means 25 frames per second. Maximum allowed value for this attribute is
   1 000 000. Zero and negative values are rejected.

rawvideo.filter/MMA_Video_FrameCount

 NAME
   MMA_Video_FrameCount (V51) [..G.Q], QUAD

 FUNCTION
   This attribute is calculated based on stream length queried on the input
   port (MMA_StreamLength attribute), video format set on output port, and
   video width and height specified with MMA_Video_Width and
   MMA_Video_Height attributes. If MMA_StreamLength reported by the source
   stream is 0 (which has meaning of "unknown"), this attribute is 0 as
   well. The same happens if the object has no stream connected on its
   input.

 NOTES
   This is a 64-bit attribute. Storage pointer in GetAttr() should point to
   a QUAD variable. When using MediaGetPort() macros, select 64-bit
   versions.

   The stream length is queried once, when input port is connected to a
   source stream.

rawvideo.filter/MMA_Video_Height

 NAME
   MMA_Video_Height (V51) [I.G.Q], LONG

 FUNCTION
   Sets video stream or picture height in pixels. The default value of this
   tag is 240 pixels.

rawvideo.filter/MMA_Video_Width

 NAME
   MMA_Video_Width (V51) [I.G.Q], LONG

 FUNCTION
   Sets video stream or picture width in pixels. The default value of this
   tag is 320 pixels.

rawvideo.filter/MMM_Pull

 NAME
   MMM_Pull -- Writes video data to specified buffer. (V51)

 SYNOPSIS
   ULONG DoMethod(Object *obj, MMM_Pull, ULONG port, APTR buffer, ULONG
   length);

 FUNCTION
   Pulls needed amount of raw video data from input. As the object does not
   process the data in any way, the request is simply forwarded to the
   previous object.

 INPUTS
   obj - object to perform method on.
   port - number of port, data must be pulled from port 1 (output).
   buffer - destination buffer for data.
   length - amount of data to be pulled in *bytes*.

 RESULT
   Number of bytes pulled, secondary error information via MMA_ErrorCode.

rawvideo.filter/MMM_Seek

 NAME
   MMM_Seek -- Moves raw video stream pointer to a new position. (V51)

 SYNOPSIS
   ULONG DoMethod(Object *obj, MMM_Pull, ULONG port, ULONG type, QUAD*
   position);

 FUNCTION
   A rawvideo.filter objects does not process data and does not have any
   internal buffers. It also knows frame size and sample rate, so it only
   supports frame seek and time seek (byte seek cannot be used). Time seek
   is converted to frames (with rounding down if neccesary) using the video
   frame rate defined with MMA_Video_FpsNumerator and
   MMA_Video_FpsDenominator. Frame seek is converted to byte seek, based on
   video dimensions specified with MMA_Video_Width and MMA_Video_Height and
   specified output format. Resulting byte seek is passed to the stream
   connected on input port.

 INPUTS
   obj - object to perform method on.
   port - number of port, seek must be done on port 1 (output).
   buffer - type of seek, MMM_SEEK_TIME or MMM_SEEK_FRAMES.
   position - a pointer to a QUAD variable holding the new position. It is
     in frames for frame seek and in microseconds for time seek.

 RESULT
   Boolean value of success. Secondary error information is available via
   MMA_ErrorCode attribute.
