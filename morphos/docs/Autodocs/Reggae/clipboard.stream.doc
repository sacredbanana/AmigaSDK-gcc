 DESCRIPTION
   The class reads data from the system clipboard. It is designed for simple
   applications, not using clipboard notifications. The class takes care of
   reading clip length and also performing the final read past end of clip
   unlocking the clip for writing.

 NEW ATTRIBUTES
   MMA_StreamName              (V51)    [I.G.Q], STRPTR
   MMA_StreamHandle            (V51)    [I.G.Q], LONG

clipboard.stream/MMA_StreamHandle

 NAME
   MMA_StreamHandle (V51) [..G.Q], LONG

 FUNCTION
   Specifies or returns clipboard unit as a number. For the constructor this
   attribute has priority over MMA_StreamName. If none of them is specified,
   clipboard unit defaults to 0.

 NOTES
   MorphOS clipboard.device supports 2^32 units (full ULONG range).

 SEE ALSO
   MMA_StreamName

clipboard.stream/MMA_StreamLength

 NAME
   MMA_StreamLength (V51) [..G.Q], QUAD

 FUNCTION
   Returns clip length in bytes.

 NOTES
   This is 64-bit attribute, in spite of clips cannot be bigger than 2 GB.

clipboard.stream/MMA_StreamName

 NAME
   MMA_StreamName (V51) [..G.Q], STRPTR

 FUNCTION
   Specifies or returns clipboard unit as a string. The string represents
   clipboard unit number as decimal string without leading zeros. For the
   constructor MMA_StreamHandle attribute has priority over this one. If
   none of them is specified, clipboard unit defaults to 0. When this
   attribute is read, the string returned must be treated as read-only.

 NOTES
   The string is converted to number with dos.library/StrToLong().

 BUGS
   Current version supports only units up to 2 147 483 647 ($7FFFFFFF).

clipboard.stream/MMA_StreamPosBytes

 NAME
   MMA_StreamPosBytes (V51) [..G.Q], QUAD

 FUNCTION
   Returns current read position in the clip in bytes.

 NOTES
   This is 64-bit attribute, in spite of clips cannot be bigger than 2 GB.

clipboard.stream/MMA_StreamSeekable

 NAME
   MMA_StreamSeekable (V51) [..G.Q], BOOL

 FUNCTION
   Returns TRUE always, clipboard streams are seekable.

clipboard.stream/MMM_Pull

 NAME
   MMM_Pull -- Reads data from clipboard (V51)

 SYNOPSIS
   int DoMethod(obj, MMM_Pull, int port, char *buffer, int length);

 FUNCTION
   Reads block of data from clipboard.

 INPUTS
   port - clipboard.stream object has only one port, port 0.
   buffer - pointer to the destination data buffer.
   length - number of requested bytes.

 RESULT
   Number of bytes really read and stored to the buffer. May be less than
   requested in case of reaching end of clip (error code MMERR_END_OF_DATA
   is set), or encountering error (error code MMERR_IO_ERROR).

clipboard.stream/MMM_Seek

 NAME
   MMM_Seek -- Seeks in a clip to specified absolute position. (V50)

 SYNOPSIS
   result = DoMethod(obj, MMM_Seek, ULONG port, ULONG type, QUAD
   *position);

 FUNCTION
   Seeks in a clip data to specified absolute position. Clipboard.stream
   understands MMM_SEEK_BYTES type only.

 INPUTS
   - obj, object to perform the method on.
   - port, always 0, as it is the only port in a clipboard.stream object.
   - type, MMM_SEEK_BYTES.
   - position, pointer to QUAD variable containing desired position in the
     clip.

 RESULT
   Boolean value, TRUE if seek was succesfull. Additional information via
   MMA_ErrorCode attribute:
   - MMERR_WRONG_ARGUMENTS - negative position or seek past end of clip.

clipboard.stream/OM_DISPOSE

 NAME
   OM_DISPOSE -- Disposes clipboard.stream object. (V51)

 SYNOPSIS
   DisposeObject(obj);

 FUNCTION
   Performs final read past clip end, unlocking the clip for other
   applications. Closes clipboard.device unit, disposes request, deletes
   message port, then disposes object.

 INPUTS
   obj - object to be disposed

 RESULT
   None.

 SEE ALSO
   OM_NEW

clipboard.stream/OM_NEW

 NAME
   OM_NEW -- Creates new clipboard.stream object (V51)

 SYNOPSIS
   obj = NewObject(NULL, "clipboard.stream", ...);

 FUNCTION
   Creates a new instance of clipboard.stream. Creates request message port,
   request, opens clipboard.device unit. Note that the unit is blocked until
   the object is disposed. This blocks all writes to this unit. Because of
   this, applications should dispose clipboard.stream objects immediately
   after reading is finished. Clipboard unit to open may be specified either
   with MMA_StreamHandle or MMA_StreamName. If none of them is specified,
   unit 0 is opened. If both are specified, MMA_StreamHandle takes
   precedence. MMA_ErrorCode tag may be also specified as for any Reggae
   constructor.

 RESULT
   Pointer to created object or NULL in case of failure. Additional error
   code may be stored at pointer passed with MMA_ErrorCode. Possible codes
   are:
   - MMERR_OUT_OF_MEMORY, obvious.
   - MMERR_RESOURCE_MISSING, message port cannot be created, clipboard unit
     cannot be opened.
   - MMERR_END_OF_DATA, clipboard unit is empty.
