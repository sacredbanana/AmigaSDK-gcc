 NAME
   MMA_DataFormat -- (V51) [..G.Q], CONST_STRPTR, 0x8EDA000B

 FUNCTION
   Returns short, read-only textual description of the format. An object
   connected to a data stream returns string "GZip".

 NOTES
   Usually, when gzip.demuxer is a part of processing pipeline built with
   MediaNewObject(), this attribute is "shadowed" by demuxer(s) following
   in the pipeline.

gzip.demuxer/MMA_MimeType

 NAME
   MMA_MimeType -- (V51) [..G.Q], CONST_STRPTR, 0x8EDA000A

 FUNCTION
   Returns MIME type string of the format. An object connected to a data
   stream returns string "application/x-gzip"

 NOTES
   Usually, when gzip.demuxer is a part of processing pipeline built with
   MediaNewObject(), this attribute is "shadowed" by demuxer(s) following
   in the pipeline.

gzip.demuxer/MMA_StreamLength

 NAME
   MMA_StreamLength -- (V51) [..G.Q], QUAD*, 0x8EDA0018

 FUNCTION
   MMA_StreamLength is the output (uncompressed) stream length in bytes. For
   gzip.demuxer the length can be 0 (which means unknown length), as GZip might
   not always know the uncompressed length. The attribute is defined as a
   pointer to 64-bit signed number containing the length.

 NOTE
   This tag always return 0 (unknown) length in V51.1. It might be
   implemented in later class versions.

gzip.demuxer/MMA_StreamPosBytes

 NAME
   MMA_StreamPosBytes -- (V51) [..G.Q], QUAD*, 0x8EDA0012

 FUNCTION
   MMA_StreamPosBytes value is the current position in the output
   (uncompressed) stream. This position is in bytes, and is returned as a
   pointer to 64-bit signed number.

gzip.demuxer/MMM_Pull

 NAME
   MMM_Pull (V51) -- Decompresses a block of data into a buffer.

 SYNOPSIS
   bytes = DoMethod(obj, MMM_Pull, ULONG port, APTR buffer, ULONG length);

 FUNCTION
   Delivers a specified amount of decompressed data to the output buffer.

 INPUTS
   - obj, object to perform the method on.
   - port, number of port, must be 1 (output).
   - buffer, a memory buffer for decompressed data, must be aligned to
     16-byte boundary (preferrably allocated with MediaAllocVec()).
   - length, amount of pulled data in bytes.

 RESULT
   Number of bytes pulled actually. In case of error, additional information
   is available via MMA_ErrorCode attribute.

 DESCRIPTION
   This class allows Reggae to handle data compressed with GZip compressor.
   In other words it is a wrapper on z.library. Using this class Reggae
   can decompress data from any GZip source stream.

   Reggae is able to cascade demuxers in case of compound data formats. When
   MediaNewObject() recognizes a stream, it detects GZip packed files with
   this class recognition routine. gzip.demuxer object sets MMF_STREAM data
   type on its output, which makes Reggae to perform demultiplexer matching
   recursively, but this time on decompressed data.

 NEW ATTRIBUTES
   Attributes applicability:
     I - may be set at creation time.
     S - may be set on an existing object.
     G - may be get from an object.
     P - may be set for an object's port.
     Q - may be queried from an object's port.
