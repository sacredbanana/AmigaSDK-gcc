 DESCRIPTION
   This is a Reggae filter used for importing raw audio data in several
   formats into Reggae. The filter does not process data, it is only used to
   attach format tag to raw data stream pulled from a stream object. It is
   also used to specify basic audio parameters like number of channels and
   sampling rate. The filter accepts MMF_STREAM format on its input, it
   means that a stream object should be the source of data. It can be for
   example memory stream to fetch data from a memory buffer, or file.stream
   to load raw data from disk. The real format of data is specified by
   setting MMA_Port_Format attribute for the output port. When no format is
   set, the default one is MMFC_AUDIO_INT16. Then number of channels and
   sampling rate is set with object's attributes (see below). The output
   format may be one of the three common audio formats of Reggae, or one of
   many encoded formats. If it is an encoded format, a decoder is usually
   connected to the object's output. An rawaudio.filter object will allow
   for following output formats:

   Common formats:
   - MMFC_AUDIO_INT16,
   - MMFC_AUDIO_INT32,
   - MMFC_AUDIO_FLOAT32,

   Encoded formats:
   - MMF_AUDIO_PCM8,
   - MMF_AUDIO_PCM8U,
   - MMF_AUDIO_PCM16BE,
   - MMF_AUDIO_PCM16LE,
   - MMF_AUDIO_PCM16UBE,
   - MMF_AUDIO_PCM16ULE,
   - MMF_AUDIO_PCM24BE,
   - MMF_AUDIO_PCM24LE,
   - MMF_AUDIO_PCM32BE,
   - MMF_AUDIO_PCM32LE,
   - MMF_AUDIO_PCMF32LE,
   - MMF_AUDIO_MULAW,
   - MMF_AUDIO_ALAW.

   MMM_Seek(port, type, position)  (V51)

 HISTORY
   51.6  (04.10.2012)
   - Fixed broken error forwarding in MMM_Pull().

   51.5  (13.06.2011)
   - Added MMF_AUDIO_PCM16UBE and MMF_AUDIO_PCM16ULE to the format table.
   - Uses shared MediaTimeToAudioFrame() in MMM_Seek().
   - Requires multimedia.class v53.

   51.4  (05.11.2009)
   - Implemented MMA_Sound_Volume attribute.

   51.3  (22.03.2007)
   - Implemented MMA_Sound_FrameCount attribute.

   51.2  (19.11.2005)
   - Added audio common formats to allowed output formats.

   51.1 (07.06.2005)
   - Initial release.

rawaudio.filter/MMA_Sound_BitsPerSample

 NAME
   MMA_Sound_BitsPerSample (V51) [..G.Q], ULONG

 FUNCTION
   Specifies the number of bits per single sound sample (not frame). It
   depends strictly on the format specified for output port.

rawaudio.filter/MMA_Sound_Channels

 NAME
   MMA_Sound_Channels (V51) [I.G.Q], ULONG

 FUNCTION
   Specifies the number of interleaved sound channels in the raw data. The
   default value for this tag is 1. Reggae supports up to 256 channels.

rawaudio.filter/MMA_Sound_FrameCount

 NAME
   MMA_Sound_FrameCount (V51) [..G.Q], UQUAD*

 FUNCTION
   Specifies the number of sound frames in the raw stream. The calculation
   is based on stream length as reported by the connected stream class, the
   output format set on port 1 and specified MMA_Sound_Channels number.
   That is why, this attribute should be queried only after setting raw
   sound attributes and connecting port 0 of the object to the source
   stream.

 NOTES
   As every 64-bit attribute, it is passed as a pointer to the 64-bit value.

   MMA_Sound_Channels, miltimedia.class/MMA_Port_Format

rawaudio.filter/MMA_Sound_SampleRate

 NAME
   MMA_Sound_SampleRate (V51) [I.G.Q], ULONG

 FUNCTION
   Specifies the sample rate of the raw data in samples per second. The
   default value for this tag is 8000. Reggae itself will accept any value,
   but some filters, and especially encoders and audio.output class will
   limit the choice of sampling rate.

rawaudio.filter/MMA_Sound_Volume

 NAME
   MMA_Sound_Volume (V51.4) [I.G.Q], ULONG

 FUNCTION
   Specifies the default sound volume from 0 (silence) to 65536 (full
   volume). The default is full volume.

rawaudio.filter/MMM_Pull

 NAME
   MMM_Pull -- Writes audio data to specified buffer. (V51)

 SYNOPSIS
   ULONG DoMethod(Object *obj, MMM_Pull, ULONG port, APTR buffer, ULONG
   length);

 FUNCTION
   Pulls needed amount of raw audio data from input. As the object does not
   process the data in any way, the request is simply forwarded to the
   previous object.

 INPUTS
   obj - object to perform method on.
   port - number of port, data must be pulled from port 1 (output).
   buffer - destination buffer for data.
   length - amount of data to be pulled in *bytes*.

 RESULT
   Number of bytes pulled, secondary error information via MMA_ErrorCode.

 SEE ALSO
   multimedia.class/MMA_ErrorCode

rawaudio.filter/MMM_Seek

 NAME
   MMM_Seek -- Moves stream pointer to a new position. (V51)

 SYNOPSIS
   ULONG DoMethod(Object *obj, MMM_Pull, ULONG port, ULONG type, UQUAD*
   position);

 FUNCTION
   A rawaudio.filter objects does not process data and does not have any
   internal buffers. It also knows frame size and sample rate, so it only
   supports frame seek and time seek (byte seek cannot be used). Time seek
   is converted to frames (with rounding down if neccesary) using
   MMA_Sound_SampleRate specified. Frame seek is converted to byte seek,
   based on MMA_Sound_Channels and specified output format. Resulting byte
   seek is passed to the connected stream.

 INPUTS
   obj - object to perform method on.
   port - number of port, seek must be done on port 1 (output).
   buffer - type of seek, MMM_SEEK_TIME or MMM_SEEK_FRAMES.
   position - a pointer to an UQUAD variable holding the new position. It is
     in frames for frame seek and in microseconds for time seek.

 RESULT
   Number of bytes pulled, secondary error information via MMA_ErrorCode.
   Seek operation may fail if the connected stream is not seekable.
