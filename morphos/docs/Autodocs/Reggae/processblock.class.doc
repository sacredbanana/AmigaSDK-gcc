 NAME
   MMM_AddForward -- adds link from group port to object port. (V51)

 SYNOPSIS
   BOOL DoMethod(Object *obj, MMM_AddForward, Object *fwdobject, ULONG
   fwdport);

 FUNCTION
   Adds virtual connection from a group port to some port of object inside
   the group. After that all operations on group port are automatically
   forwarded to the real port of the group member.

 INPUTS
   fwdobject - a member of the group, forward will point to it.
   fwdport - number of port in 'fwdobject', where forward will be directed.

 RESULT
   Boolean value of success. The method will fail if the destination port
   does not exist or the forward target object is NULL.

 BUGS
   The method does not check if the forward target object belongs to the
   group. The method also does not set MMA_ErrorCode in case of failure.

processblock.class/MMM_IsMember

 NAME
   MMM_IsMember -- checks if an object belongs to object block. (V51)

 SYNOPSIS
   BOOL DoMethod(Object *obj, MMM_IsMember, Object *check)

 FUNCTION
   The method checks if an object is member of the group.

 INPUTS
   check - object, which membership is checked.

 RESULT
   TRUE if checked object belongs to the group, FALSE otherwise.

processblock.class/OM_ADDMEMBER

 NAME
   OM_ADDMEMBER -- adds object to object block. (V51)

 SYNOPSIS
   DoMethod(Object *obj, OM_ADDMEMBER, Object *member);

 FUNCTION
   Adds a Reggae object to the group. This operation does not change port
   connections of the added object.

 INPUTS
   member - object to be added.

 RESULT
   Boolean value of success. The method may fail in low memory conditions.

processblock.class/OM_DISPOSE

 NAME
   OM_DISPOSE -- disposes object of processblock.class. (V51)

 SYNOPSIS
   DisposeObject(Object *obj);

 FUNCTION
   Disposes all the objects inside the group, then disposes the group
   itself. All the connections going outside the group are disconnected.

 INPUTS
   None.

 RESULT
   None.

processblock.class/OM_NEW

 NAME
   OM_NEW -- creates new object of processblock.class. (V51)

 SYNOPSIS
   Object* NewObject(NULL, "processblock.class", ..., TAG_END);
   Object* NewObjectA(NULL, "processblock.class", taglist);

 FUNCTION
   Creates an empty object group with no ports. Objects may be added to the
   group with OM_ADDMEMBER(), ports of the group are created with
   MMM_AddPort(), and connected to ports of object inside the group with
   MMM_AddForward().

 INPUTS
   taglist - object attributes. Currently no tags are defined for the class.

 RESULT
   Empty group object or NULL. Failure may be caused by low memory
   condition.

   OM_ADDMEMBER(), MMM_AddPort(), MMM_AddForward()

processblock.class/OM_REMMEMBER

 NAME
   OM_REMMEMBER -- removes object from object block. (V51)

 SYNOPSIS
   void DoMethod(Object *obj, OM_REMMEMBER, Object *member);

 FUNCTION
   Removes Reggae object from object group. This method does not change port
   connections of removed object.

 INPUTS
   member - object to be removed. Removing object not belonging to the
   group is safe, method just does nothing then.

 RESULT
   None.

 BUGS
   The method does not clear port forwards of removed object.

 SEE ALSO
    OM_ADDMEMBER()

processblock.class/__background__

 DESCRIPTION
   The class is used to group multiple Reggae objects. Then the group may
   be treated as a single object. Ports of this compound object are
   forwarded to selected ports of inner objects.

   Objects are grouped automatically by MediaNewObjectTagList(), also
   applications may group their objects in any way.

   Performing a forwarded method on a port of object group relays the
   method to the real port of the group member. Following methods are
   relayed:
   - MMM_SetPort()
   - MMM_GetPort()
   - MMM_SetPortFwd()
   - MMM_GetPortFwd()
   - MMM_Pull()
   - MMM_Seek()
   - MMM_Setup()
   - MMM_Cleanup()
   - MMM_QueryMetaData()

 HISTORY
   51.7 (11.11.2015)
   - All the forwarded methods set MMERR_BROKEN_PIPE if specified
     processblock port does not exist.
