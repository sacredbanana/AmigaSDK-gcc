This drawer contains the program all files in LOCALE:countries were
generated with. It serves as starting point for generating your
own .country files.

To build with SAS/C, call

sc idir=V:include data=far link make_country_files.c

(V:include is the path to the OS4 includes) and then call
make_country_files which will create a subdirectory Countries/
in the current directory.

To build a PPC version (called make_country_files.elf) with gcc, call

make -f GNUMakefile.os4
