OS4 charset driver examples
----------------------------

An OS4 charset driver can be found in LOCALE:Charsets/. Its a system
library that implements basic charset-related functions, e.g.
ConvToUpper() or IsAlpha(). If you dont know how to build an OS4 system
library, ask a programmer for help.

You basically just need to copy e.g. ISO-8859-15.c to
MIME-NAME-OF-MY-CHARSET.c, modify the character property and conversion
tables, use BumpRev to create MIME-NAME-OF-MY-CHARSET_rev.h, add your
driver to the makefiles and call "make". You may need the OS4 SDK.
You may also need to change the include paths in the makefile, e.g.
V:include -> ../include plus SDK:include.
