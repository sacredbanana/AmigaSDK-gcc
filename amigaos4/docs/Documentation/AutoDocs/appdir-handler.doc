   NAME
	appdir-handler -- The DOS handler for the APPDIR filesystem. (V54)

   SYNOPSIS
	APPDIR Filesystem.

   FUNCTION
	The appdir-handler creates the "APPDIR" filesystem DOS device.
	The filesystem presents the contents of ENVARC:Appdir/ as a disk
	of softlinks that causes DOS to automatically resolve all references
	to the target objects, as it would do with any softlink.

	Appdir-handler also starts a server process to monitor DOS LoadSeg()
	events and maintain the ENVARC:AppDir/ global variables.
  
	The appdir-handler file must reside in the default L: directory
	so that automatic updates can occur, relocating it will cause problems.

	The appdir-handler can be loaded and started in one of two ways, the 
	automatic and prefered installation uses method (1).

	(1) An APPDIR mountlist entry added to DEVS:DOSDrivers/ that contains...
	        Handler = L:appdir-handler
	        GlobVec = -1

	(2) An entry added to the SYS:Kickstart/KickLayout file that contains...
	        MODULE  L/appdir-handler

   NOTES
	For objects to be found in APPDIR: they must have been loaded at some
	time before, this may be by being run at least once, or by simply
	having the version information read by the 'C:Version' command,
	this will cause the file to be loaded so the version data can
	be accessed, and this is all that is required to create an initial
	appdir cache entry.
	All objects loaded by RAMLIB are currently excluded from APPDIR:
	such as libraries and devices, as are all files such as kickstart
	modules, classes, gadgets, images, etc... with the following named
	suffixes;   ".library", ".device", ".gadget", ".image", ".class",
	".kmod", ".chip", "-handler".
	All loadables from "ENV:", "ENVARC:", "RAM:" and "RAM:T" are also
	excluded from being cached.
	The APPDIR: cache is automatically flushed every other month of 
	entries that have paths that no longer exist, unused entries are
	removed after 12 full months of no access.
