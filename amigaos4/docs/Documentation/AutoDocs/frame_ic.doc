    NAME
	frameiclass -- embossed frame image class

    SUPERCLASS
	imageclass

    REQUIRES
	None

    DESCRIPTION
	This is a class of framing image which can optionally fill itself.
	Its purpose is to frame other display elements using an embossed
	or recessed rectangular frame. The frame renders itself using the
	appropriate DrawInfo pens (SHINEPEN, SHADOWPEN, etc.). This class
	is intelligent enough to bound or center its contents.

    METHODS
	OM_NEW -- Create the frameiclass object. Passed to superclass.

	OM_GET -- Get value of an attribute. Passed to superclass first.

	OM_SET -- Set object attributes. Passed to superclass first.

	IM_DRAW -- Draw frame image with state.

	IM_DRAWFRAME -- Draw frame image within limits.

	IM_FRAMEBOX -- Get recommended frame around some box.

	IM_EXTENT -- Inquire about rendering extent.

	IM_EXTENTFRAME -- Inquire about rendering extent with dimensions.

	All other methods are passed to the superclass.

    ATTRIBUTES
	IA_FrameType (uint32)
	    The type of frame to use. The frame choices are as follows:
	      FRAME_DEFAULT
	        V37-type frame which has thin edges.

	      FRAME_BUTTON
	        Button gadget frames with thicker sides and nicely
           edged corners.

	      FRAME_RIDGE
           A ridge such as used by standard string gadgets.
           You can recess the ridge to get a groove image.

	      FRAME_ICONDROPBOX
	        A broad ridge which is the standard imagery for areas
	        in AppWindows where icons may be dropped.

	      FRAME_PROPBORDER
	        A frame suitable for use as border of a proportional
	        gadget container. (V50)

	      FRAME_PROPKNOB
	        A frame suitable for use as knob of a proportional
           gadget. (V50)

	      FRAME_DISPLAY
	        A recessed frame for display elements, such as read-only
	        text or number gadgets. (V50)

	    Defaults to FRAME_DEFAULT.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_GET)

	IA_Recessed (BOOL)
	    If this attribute is TRUE a frameiclass object will appear
	    recessed into the drawing surface. It does this by swapping
	    its use of the SHADOWPEN and SHINEPEN. By default, the frame
	    appears to be raised from the surface.

	    Defaults to FALSE.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_GET)

	IA_EdgesOnly (BOOL)
	    If this attribute is TRUE the frame does not fill itself and
	    just draws its edges.

	    Defaults to FALSE.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_GET)

	IA_Orientation (uint32)
	    Defines the orientation of the frame for images needing this
	    kind of information such as the PROPKNOB frameiclass type or
	    gaugeiclass. The orientation can either be horizontal (0) or
	    vertical (1).

	    Defaults to 0 (horizontal).

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_GET)

	IA_Simple (BOOL)
	    This attribute indicates whether the image should be drawn
	    with the most plain graphic appearance it supports. For
	    frameiclass this means to drop fancy styles like XEN or
	    rounded corners. (V50)

	    Defaults to FALSE (user-selected style).

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_GET)

	IA_SupportsDisable (BOOL)
	    By default Intuition ghosts gadgets itself instead of
	    relying on IDS_DISABLED or IDS_SELECTEDDISABLED states.
	    An imageclass that supports these states will return this
	    attribute as TRUE. Applications should not set or clear
	    this attribute.

	    Defaults to FALSE.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_GET)

	IA_BGPen (uint16)
	    This attribute overrides the default IA_BGPen attribute
	    as found in imageclass. It defines the background pen to
	    use for rendering the frame.

	    Defaults to FOREGROUNDPEN for frames not in a border.
	    For frames in a Window's border it defaults to FILLPEN
	    if the Window is active or INACTIVEFILLPEN otherwise.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_GET)

	IA_BackFill (struct Hook *)
	    Pointer to the backfill hook to use for rendering in
	    the IDS_NORMAL state. For more on the backfill hook,
	    see layers.library/InstallLayerInfoHook(). (V50)

	    Defaults to NULL.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_GET)

	IA_SelectedBackFill (struct Hook *)
	    Pointer to the backfill hook to use for rendering in
	    a selected state. For more on the backfill hook,
	    see layers.library/InstallLayerInfoHook(). (V50)

	    Defaults to NULL.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_GET)

	IA_DisabledBackFill (struct Hook *)
	    Pointer to the backfill hook to use for rendering in
	    a disabled state. For more on the backfill hook,
	    see layers.library/InstallLayerInfoHook(). (V50)

	    Defaults to NULL.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_GET)

	IA_InactiveBackFill (struct Hook *)
	    Pointer to the backfill hook to use for rendering in
	    an inactive state. For more on the backfill hook,
	    see layers.library/InstallLayerInfoHook(). (V50)

	    Defaults to NULL.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_GET)

	IA_EraseBackground (BOOL)
 	    This attribute can be used to tell the image to erase
	    the background before rendering the image. (V51)

	    Defaults to TRUE for images having a non-rectangular
	    or anti-aliased shape or else FALSE.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET)

	IA_InBorder (BOOL)
	    Flag to indicate if this image to be drawn inside a
	    Window's border or not. (V51)

	    Defaults to FALSE.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET)

frameiclass/IM_DRAW                                           frameiclass/IM_DRAW

    NAME
	IM_DRAW -- Draw frame image with state.

    SYNOPSIS
	uint32 result = IDoMethodA(APTR obj, struct impDraw* msg);

    FUNCTION
	This method tells a frameiclass object to render itself using
	the position and dimensions of its Image structure.

	Depending on the state (passed in the impDraw.imp_State field)
	the frame (of type IA_FrameType) will be rendered in different
	ways.

    INPUTS
	obj - frame object pointer
	msg - pointer to fully initialized struct impDraw
	      (see <intuition/imageclass.h>)

    RESULT
	The return value for this method is not explicitly defined.

frameiclass/IM_DRAWFRAME                                 frameiclass/IM_DRAWFRAME

    NAME
	IM_DRAWFRAME -- Draw frame image within limits.

    SYNOPSIS
	uint32 result = IDoMethodA(APTR obj, struct impDraw* msg);

    FUNCTION
	This method is almost the same as the frameiclass IM_DRAW method
	except this method accepts a width and height that overrides the
	width and height stored in the object's Image structure. It uses
	the same drawing states as the frameiclass's IM_DRAW method.

    INPUTS
	obj - frame object pointer
	msg - pointer to fully initialized struct impDraw
	      (see <intuition/imageclass.h>)

    RESULT
	The return value for this method is not explicitly defined.
