    FUNCTION
	Usually a font panel will allow the user to select a font from all standard
	and user defined font families. However, sometimes it might be necessary
	to restrict this selection to i.e. TrueType fonts when bitmap fonts cannot
	be used for application specific reasons.

	This attribute allows to specify the types of font families to select from.
	Just pass a logical OR of the suitable MUIV_Fontpanel_ShowCollection_#?
	values.

    EXAMPLE
	/* let the user choose TrueType fonts only */
	FontpanelObject,
	  MUIA_Fontpanel_ShowCollection, MUIV_Fontpanel_ShowCollection_TrueType,
	  End;
