con-handler/con_handler                               con-handler/con_handler

   NAME
   con-handler -- standard console window handler

   SYNOPSIS
   NewShell WINDOW "CON:x/y/width/height/title/options"

   Open("CON:x/y/width/height/title/options",...);
   Open("RAW:x/y/width/height/title/options",...);

   FUNCTION
   The con-handler is typically used by the Shell. The user enters
   commands or edits the command line, and the output produced by
   the command is displayed in a console window. The window can be
   sized, dragged, zoomed and depth-adjusted like most other
   Amiga windows.

   The console window is a 'virtual terminal' which data can be
   exchanged with using standard file I/O operations.

   WINDOW SPECIFICATION
   You select the initial dimensions, location, title and other
   properties of the console window through a window specification
   like this:

       CON:x/y/width/height/title/options

   where:

       x
           Is the number of pixels from the left edge of the screen to
           the left border of the console window. Use no value (//) to
           specify the minimum possible pixels. Use the value -1 to
           generate a window that is centred horizontally on the screen.

       y
           Is the number of pixels from the top of the screen to the top
           of the console window. Use no value (//) to specify the
           minimum possible pixels. Use the value -1 to generate a window
           that is centred vertically on the screen.

       width
           Is the width of the console window, in pixels. Use no value
           (//) to specify the full width of the screen.

       height
           Is the height of the console window, in pixels. Use no value
           (//) to specify minimum possible height.

       title
           Is the text that appears in the console window title bar.

   Use slashes to separate the parameters and options.

   The allowable options are:

       AUTO
           The window automatically appears when the program needs input
           or produces output. Selecting the Shell's close gadget closes
           the window, but it re-opens immediately since it is expecting
           input.

       ALT
           The window appears in the specified size and position when the
           zoom gadget is clicked. The four parameters must be separated
           with slashes (for example, ALT30/30/200/200).

       BACKDROP
           The window appears on the backdrop, behind all the Workbench
           windows. This console window cannot be brought to the front of
           the screen; you have to resize the Workbench windows to see it.

       CHARSET
           The window font will be opened with the specified charset if
           possible. The charset is specified as a string, e.g.
           CHARSET=ISO-8859-15.

       CLOSE
           The window has all the standard gadgets, including a close
           gadget.

       COLUMNS
           Specify the number of columns in the window to be opened, given
           as the number of characters rather than as pixels. This option
           overrides the 'width' parameter of the window specification.

       FORCEVISIBLE
           By default, a console window is opened with the "AutoAdjust"
           option, meaning that Intuition can move or shrink the window to
           make it fit on the screen. The actual implementation is undefined
           in the Intuition documentation and no action is performed on the
           "Alt" window position.
           The "ForceVisible" option causes the console to check the window
           size and position (for both "normal" and "Alt" settings) and will
           guarantee that the top left-hand corner of the window opens on the
           screen. The "Top" and "Left" settings are adjusted as necessary,
           but the window size is not changed. If the screen size is larger
           than the displayed size, the console window can still appear off
           the visible screen, but will appear when the screen is scrolled.
           If "ForceVisible" is specified, the "AutoAdjust" option is 
           disabled.

       HISTORY (Obsolete)
           This option is now the default and is ignored.

       INACTIVE
           The window opens, but is not made the active window.

       LEGACY
           This option forces the window to be opened without history, 
           ClickTab or a scrollbar. It might be useful to use with older,
           non-conforming applications that use the console. If this option
           and the TABBED option are both present on the command line, the
           LEGACY option will take precedence.
           The NOHISTORY option is a synonym for this option but can be
           over-ruled by a later TABBED option.
           Refer also to the notes for the TABBED option.

       NEWLOOKMENUS
           The window will open with the WFLG_NEWLOOKMENUS flag
           set which affects the menu color scheme. Normally this
           option is only set by applications which want to add a
           menu with the GTMN_NewLookMenus flag to the window.
           Ignored in console V53.x.

       NOAPPWINDOW
           The window is not registered as an AppWindow, you can't drop
           icons onto it, and workbench.library wont be opened.
           This flag may be useful when you need a shell window
           which does not prevent quitting Workbench.

       NOBORDER
           The window opens without any left or bottom window border.
           Only the zoom, depth, and sizing gadgets are available.

       NOCLOSE
           The window does not have a close gadget. If you open a console
           normally, there is no close gadget. If you open a console
           using the AUTO option, there is automatically a close gadget
           on the window.

       NODEPTH
           The window has no window depth gadget.

       NODRAG
           The window cannot be dragged. It has zoom, depth and sizing
           gadgets, but no close gadget.

       NOHISTORY (Obsolete, use the LEGACY option)
           This is a synonym for the LEGACY option, but differs in that it
           can be over-ruled by a later TABBED option.
           Default: disabled (HISTORY enabled).

       NOICONIFY
           The window is opened without an iconify gadget. The window can
           still be iconified by use of the Right-Amiga+I keyboard shortcut.

       NOSIZE
           The window only has a depth gadget.

       NOSCROLLBAR
           The window opens without a scrollbar in the right border. This
           option is forced if both the HISTORY and TABBED options are
           missing.

       ROWS
           Specify the number of rows in the window to be opened, given as
           the number of characters rather than as pixels. This option
           overrides the 'height' parameter of the window specification.

       SCREEN
           The window opens on a public screen. The screen does not have to
           be already open. You specify the name of the screen after the
           SCREEN keyword. You can interpose spaces or one "=" sign between
           the SCREEN keyword and the screen name. For instance, all these
           four versions work the same:
           SCREENScreenName
           SCREEN ScreenName
           SCREEN=ScreenName
           SCREEN = ScreenName
           If the window is to open on the frontmost public screen, use 
           two * (asterisks) in place of the screen name. Note that a single
           asterisk will be "swallowed" by DOS before the con-handler sees
           it, so two are required.
           If the name after the SCREEN option is null (and not an asterisk),
           the window opens by default on the same screen as the caller.

       SIMPLE
           If you enlarge the window, the text expands to fill the newly
           available space, allowing you to see text that had been
           scrolled out of the window (always the case with the console
           V53.x).

       SMART
           If you enlarge the window, the text does not expand to fill
           the newly available space (ignored in console V53.x).

       SYNCWRITES
           This option forces all Write commands to block within the console
           until the operation is completed. Without this option, all "new"
           consoles (those created with the TABBED or HISTORY options) will
           return to the caller immediately and process Write operations
           asynchronously, meaning that internal console variables may
           not always represent the state of the finished operation. With
           this option, the console duplicates the behaviour of legacy
           windows for compatibility with older programs.

       TABBED
           The window is opened with a ClickTab gadget, allowing subsequent
           Shells to share the window frame. The currently visible and
           active Shell may then be selected by clicking on the Tab gadget
           or by using a keyboard shortcut. Closing individual Shells does
           not close the Tabbed window until all Shells have been closed.
           This option is not available with a pre-existing Window.
           If the window is opened with History enabled (ie without the
           LEGACY option), but the TABBED option is omitted, you can still
           open multiple Shells in the window, but there will be no ClickTab
           gadget. You will have to use shortcut keys or the console menu
           to switch the display from one Shell to another.
			Default: not Tabbed.

       WAIT
           The window can only be closed by selecting the close gadget or
           typing Ctrl-\ (typing EndCLI will not close the window). If 
           WAIT is specified without the CLOSE option, there is no close
           gadget and the window can only be closed by typing Ctrl-\.

       WINDOW
           A window previously opened through intuition.library/OpenWindow
           or intuition.library/OpenWindowTagList should be attached to
           the new console. The window's address must be given as a
           hexadecimal number. Any leading "0x" prefix is ignored.

   NOTES
   The COLUMNS and ROWS options were added in V51. Older releases will
   ignore these options and use the window dimensions given in the
   window specification instead.

   The NEWLOOKMENUS, CHARSET and NOAPPWINDOW options were added
   in V51, older releases will ignore it.

   Prior to V51, options and their parameters could be separated by
   exactly one blank space. Starting with V51, any number of blank
   spaces and exactly one '=' character can be used to separate
   options and their parameters.
