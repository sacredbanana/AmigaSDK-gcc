   NAME
	FindNumberOfAxis -- Find out how many axis this Device uses

   SYNOPSIS
	result = FindNumberOfAxis(IExec);

	int AIN_FindNumberOfAxis(struct ExecIFace *IExec);

   FUNCTION
       This function calculates how many axis are present (or 0, if this did
       not work).

   INPUTS
	IExec  - A pointer to IExec

   RESULT
       result - The number of axis found on this device

   NAME
	InitHardware -- Initializes the PCI Interface for a Analog Joystick
                       attached to a Soundboard. This little Driver is used
                       by the actual AmigaInput Driver, and you need to 
                       install the correct version for the soundboard you use

   SYNOPSIS
	port = InitHardware(IExec,data,ID);

	int InitHardware(struct ExecIFace *IExec,struct PC_Extra_Data
                                *data, unsigned int ID);

   FUNCTION
       This function initializes the PCI Interface for the Gameport of the
       Soundblaster Card.

   INPUTS
	IExec  - A pointer to IExec
       data   - The PC_Extra_Data private structure, as required by the
                Soundblaster Analog Joystick Driver
       ID     - The ID of the Unit to initialize

   RESULT
       port   - Returns the I/O port which should be used, or 0, if the
                function was not successful.

   NAME
	ShutdownHardware -- Frees the resources allocated for the PCI Interface
                           of the Soundboard again

   SYNOPSIS
	ShutdownHardware(IExec,data,ID);

	void ShutdownHardware(struct ExecIFace *IExec,struct PC_Extra_Data
                                *data, unsigned int ID);

   FUNCTION
       This function frees the PCI Interface for the Gameport of the
       Soundblaster Card.

   INPUTS
	IExec  - A pointer to IExec
       data   - The PC_Extra_Data private structure, as required by the
                Soundblaster Analog Joystick Driver
       ID     - The ID of the Unit to shutdown

   SEE ALSO
	InitHardware

GamePort_pci.driver/TestHardware             GamePort_pci.driver/TestHardware

   NAME
       TestHardware - tests for the presence of the hardware
   SYNOPSIS
	result = TestHardware(IExec,ID);

	int TestHardware(struct ExecIFace *IExec,unsigned int ID);

   FUNCTION
       This function test, if actually an analogue joystick is attached
       to the Soundcard. This function should not actually init or close
       the PCI Interface, but use data which was collected during the
       initialization (TestHardware will be called after InitHardware was
       called by the AmigaInput-Driver).

   INPUTS
	IExec  - A pointer to IExec
       ID     - The ID of the Unit to test

   RESULT
       result   - Returns TRUE, if a joystick is present, else FALSE.
