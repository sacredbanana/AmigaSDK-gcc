SUMMARY
-------
ListDynDep is a tool which may be used to list the dynamic dependencies
of Amiga ELF files. This command is similar to readelf but provides more
specific AmigaOS functionality. For example, ListDynDep can recursively
scan and resolve all dynamic dependencies.

See the ListDynDep.doc file for more details.
