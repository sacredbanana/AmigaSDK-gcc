   NumericList.mcc was originally developed by Flavio Stanchina.
   This is a native reimplementation included with MUI5 for convenience.

   NumericList.mcc is a subclass of List.mui and provides a list object which
   is able to display positive integer numbers in a very convenient way. From
   a developer's point of view all that is to be done is to insert integer
   numbers. There is no need to convert anything to strings. All this is done
   internally. The default implementation of MUIM_List_Compare will sort the
   numbers from small to large values.
