   NAME
      	CallRTAS -- Call the RTAS service routine

   SYNOPSIS
      	uint32 CallRTAS(uint32 * packet);

   FUNCTION
		Calls the RTAS handler with the provided packet. The packet is copied
 		into a physically mapped buffer on entry and copied back when the RTAS
 		service is finished.

   INPUTS
       packet - A pointer to an uint32 array containing the parameter packet
 				 for the RTAS call

   RESULT
       The function returns the packet from the RTAS handler in the same
 		memory area as the input packet. In addition, the first outout 
 		value of the call is returned as a return value from this function.

   EXAMPLE
 		The following example reads the time of day via RTAS.
 
 		uint32 packet[50];
 		packet[0] = IOpenFirmware->GetRTASService("get-time-of-day");
 		packet[1] = 0;
 		packet[2] = 8;
 		
 		int32 status = (int32)IOpenFirmware->CallRTAS(packet);
 
 		if (status == 0)
 		{
 			printf("The time is %2d:%2d:%2d\n",
 				packet[7], packet[8], packet[9]);
 		}
 		else
 		{
 			printf("RTAS service call failed with status %d\n", status);
 		}

   NOTES
 		IMPORTANT: All addresses passed to RTAS must be physical addresses.
 		That means that buffer addresses need to be translated between
 		virtual and physical addresses. RTAS cannot access virtual addresses
 		because the address translation is disabled when the handler is called.

   NAME
      	GetPropData -- Copy the data associated with a property

   SYNOPSIS
      	uint32 GetPropData(OFProperty property, APTR buffer, uint32 bufSize);

   FUNCTION
 		This function copies the data associated with the given property into
 		an external buffer. The buffer must be big enough to hold the entire
 		property data, otherwise nothing is copied. The copy is performed
 		verbatim, with no data conversion taking place, and any interpretation
 		of the data is up to the caller.

   INPUTS
       property - The property, as obtained by FirstProp/NextProp/FindProp
       buffer 	 - A data buffer that should receive the result 
       bufSize  - The size (in bytes) of the data buffer 

   RESULT
       The result of this function is an uint32 indicating the number of
 		bytes that have been copied. Typically, this is the size of the 
 		property data. However, if the buffer is not big enough, or there
 		was another problem, the result is zero to indicate that nothing
 		was copied.

   NAME
      	GetPropName -- Get the name of a given property

   SYNOPSIS
      	uint32 GetPropName(OFProperty property, STRPTR buffer, 
       	uint32 bufSize);

   FUNCTION
 		This function copies out the name of the indicated property into an
 		external buffer. The buffer must be big enough to hold the entire name
 		or nothing will be copied.

   INPUTS
       property 	- The property to retrieve the name of 
       buffer 		- The buffer to copy to 
       bufSize 	- The size of the buffer 

   RESULT
       The result of this function is an uint32 indicating the real number
 		of bytes that have been copied, or zero if there had been an error 
 		(for example if the buffer was too small)

   NAME
      	GetRTASService -- Map the name of an RTAS service to a token

   SYNOPSIS
      	uint32 GetRTASService(CONST_STRPTR serviceName);

   FUNCTION
 		This function maps the given RTAS service name to an RTAS calling
 		token. If the token does not exist, is invalid, or not supported
 		by this implementation of RTAS, the value RTAS_INVALID_TOKEN is 
 		returned.

   INPUTS
       serviceName - The RTAS service name to map

   RESULT
       The result of this function is either a valid calling token or the
 		generic value RTAS_INVALID_TOKEN. If the service is not supported or
 		invalid, the return value RTAS_INVALID_TOKEN indicates this. Otherwise
 		the result of this function can be used in an RTAS parameter package
 		as the service token.
