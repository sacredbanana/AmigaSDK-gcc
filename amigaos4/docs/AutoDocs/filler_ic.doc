    NAME
	filler.image -- Create filler BOOPSI objects

    SUPERCLASS
	imageclass

    DESCRIPTION
	The filler image class is primarily used to create visual entities
	used to 'fill' areas of a user interface, usually in combination
	with logos/banners/splashes, etc.

    METHODS
	OM_NEW -- Passed to superclass, defaults set, then OM_SET.

	OM_DISPOSE -- Children disposed of then passed to superclass.

	OM_SET -- Passed to superclass, custom tags set.

	OM_GET -- Custom tags returned or passed to superclass.

	IM_DRAW -- Renders the image. Overrides the superclass.

	IM_DRAWFRAME -- Renders the image in a frame.

	IM_DOMAINFRAME -- Query the image frame.

	All other methods are passed to the superclass.

    ATTRIBUTES
	FILLER_Screen (struct Screen *)
	    Screen for allocation of needed pens for the display.
	    This MUST be provided and MUST remain open until after
	    the gadget has been disposed.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET)

	FILLER_BackgroundColour (uint32)
	    Background fill colour. The image area will be filled with
	    this colour value. The full 32-bit ARGB value must be provided,
	    including the alpha-channel transparency information for blending
	    with the background. Translucent fills currently only work on
	    direct mapped screens. On CLUT screens the alpha information is
	    ignored.

	    Default for this attribute is 0 (clear/transparent).

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET)

	FILLER_TopLeftColour     (uint32)
	FILLER_TopRightColour    (uint32)
	FILLER_BottomLeftColour  (uint32)
	FILLER_BottomRightColour (uint32)
	    Overriding the background colour fill if defined, these four
	    attributes describe a four-way blended colour gradient fill.
	    Similar to the background fill colour, these attributes require
	    ARGB values.

	    Default for these attributes is 0 (clear/transparent).

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET)

	FILLER_ImageFilename (CONST_STRPTR)
	    This attribute specifies the external image file to be loaded
	    (via Datatypes) as a picture to be displayed within the filler.image.

	    Default is NULL (no image).

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET)

	FILLER_ImageBuffer (struct SizedBuffer *)
	    This attribute specifies a buffer (pointer + size) that contains the
	    Datatype image to be displayed within the filler.image. Note that the
	    format is a real image file format supported by datatypes (like PNG,
	    IFF, etc.) and not a pure Bitmap of some sort.

	    Default is NULL (no image).

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET)

	FILLER_ImageAddress (APTR)
	FILLER_ImageSize (uint32)
	    Similar to FILLER_ImageBuffer, these attributes combined provide an
	    alternative way to load the image file from a memory source. These
	    attributes must BOTH be set (everytime) before the image will be
	    loaded. The address is a pointer to the real image file format data,
	    the size attribute is the byte length of this data.

	    Default is NULL (no image).

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET).

	FILLER_ImageMode (uint32)
	    If FILLER_ImageFilename is given, these attributes define how the
	    image is displayed. See <images/filler.h> for possible values.

	    Default is FILLER_MODE_NORMAL.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET)

	FILLER_ImagePlacement (uint32)
	    This attribute compliments the FILLER_ImageMode attribute, providing
	    extra information about where the image should be displayed relative
	    to the filler image area. See <images/filler.h> for possible values,
	    more than one of which may be OR'd together.

	    Default is for the image to be centred in the middle (both
	    horizontally and vertically) of the filler image area.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET)

	FILLER_ScaleMode (uint32)
	    This attribute sets the scaling algorithm when FILLER_ImageMode is
	    set to a scaled mode.

	    Default is FILLER_SCALE_SIMPLE.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET)
