  GIFAnim.mcc was originally developed by Alfonso Ranieri for AmigaOS.
  This is an AmigaOS native reimplementation included in MUI5 for AmigaOS for
  convenience.

  GIFAnim.mcc is a subclass of Area.mui. Its main purpose is to show single
  frame GIF pictures and multiple frame GIF animations. The GIF image data will
  be parsed by an asynchronous decoder process.
GIFAnim.mcc/MUIA_GIFAnim_Anim

   NAME
   MUIA_GIFAnim_Anim -- [I.G], BOOL

   FUNCTION
   If set to FALSE the animation playback will not be started.

   Defaults to TRUE.
GIFAnim.mcc/MUIA_GIFAnim_Current

   NAME
   MUIA_GIFAnim_Current -- [ISG], LONG

   FUNCTION
   The current frame number of the animation.
GIFAnim.mcc/MUIA_GIFAnim_Data

   NAME
   MUIA_GIFAnim_Data -- [I..], CONST_APTR

   FUNCTION
   Use this attribute to let GIFAnim.mcc use embedded GIF image data instead of
   reading them from a file.
   This attribute must be specified together with MUIA_GIFAnim_DataSize.

   NOTES
   MUIA_GIFAnim_Data has precendence over MUIA_GIFAnim_File in case both are
   specified.

   SEE ALSO
   MUIA_GIFAnim_DataSize, MUIA_GIFAnim_File
GIFAnim.mcc/MUIA_GIFAnim_DataSize

   NAME
   MUIA_GIFAnim_DataSize -- [I..], ULONG

   FUNCTION
   Define the size of the data supplied with MUIA_GIFAnim_Data in bytes.
   This attribute must be specified together with MUIA_GIFAnim_Data.

   SEE ALSO
   MUIA_GIFAnim_Data, MUIA_GIFAnim_File
GIFAnim.mcc/MUIA_GIFAnim_Decoded

   NAME
   MUIA_GIFAnim_Decoded -- [..G], BOOL

   FUNCTION
   This attribute becomes TRUE as soon as the animation has been fully decoded.

   NOTES
   A finished decoding process is NO indication whether the GIF animation was
   actually successfully decoded. It just an indication that the decoding
   process finished with whatever result. Refer to MUIA_GIFAnim_Invalid to
   obtain the animation's validity.

   SEE ALSO
   MUIA_GIFAnim_Invalid
GIFAnim.mcc/MUIA_GIFAnim_Fallback

   NAME
   MUIA_GIFAnim_Fallback -- [I..], BOOL

   FUNCTION
   If set to TRUE and if the GIF image data (either from a file or from embedded
   data) is invalid and cannot be parsed successfully the MUIM_Setup method will
   still succeed and MUIA_GIFAnim_Invalid will be set to TRUE.

   If set to FALSE and if the GIF image data (either from a file or from
   embedded data) is invalid and cannot be parsed successfully the MUIM_Setup
   method will fail and hence will cause the window to be not opened.

   Defaults to TRUE.

   SEE ALSO
   MUIA_GIFAnim_Invalid
GIFAnim.mcc/MUIA_GIFAnim_File

   NAME
   MUIA_GIFAnim_File -- [I..], CONST_STRPTR

   FUNCTION
   The name of a GIF file to be parsed. The supplied string will be copied
   internally.

   SEE ALSO
   MUIA_GIFAnim_Data, MUIA_GIFAnim_DataSize
GIFAnim.mcc/MUIA_GIFAnim_Invalid

   NAME
   MUIA_GIFAnim_Invalid -- [..G], BOOL

   FUNCTION
   This attribute will be set to TRUE in case the GIF image data cannot be
   parsed for any reason and MUIA_GIFAnim_Fallback is set to TRUE.

   SEE ALSO
   MUIA_GIFAnim_Fallback
GIFAnim.mcc/MUIA_GIFAnim_Pics

   NAME
   MUIA_GIFAnim_Pics -- [..G], LONG

   FUNCTION
   Returns the number of frames in the animation.

   The returned number is valid only if all frames have been completely decoded
   and MUIA_GIFAnim_Decoded is TRUE. Otherwise -1 will be returned.

   SEE ALSO
   MUIA_GIFAnim_Decoded
GIFAnim.mcc/MUIA_GIFAnim_Precision

   NAME
   MUIA_GIFAnim_Precision -- [I..], ULONG

   FUNCTION
   Precision to use when obtaining pens.

   The precision may be one of:
    - PRECISION_GUI
    - PRECISION_ICON
    - PRECISION_IMAGE
    - PRECISION_EXACT

   Defaults to PRECISION_IMAGE.

   NOTES
   GIFAnim.mcc will use pens on colormapped screens only. For truecolor screens
   no pens will be obtained and all image data will be converted to ARGB for a
   penless display.

   SEE ALSO
   MUIA_GIFAnim_Decoded
GIFAnim.mcc/MUIA_GIFAnim_Scale

   NAME
   MUIA_GIFAnim_Scale -- [I..], ULONG

   FUNCTION
   Scale factor in the range 1..16383. The value will be devided by 100.

   Defaults to 100 (unscaled image).
GIFAnim.mcc/MUIA_GIFAnim_Sync

   NAME
   MUIA_GIFAnim_Sync -- [I..], BOOL

   FUNCTION
   If set to TRUE the decoding process will be synchronous and the MUIM_Setup
   method will be delayed until all GIF frames have been decoded. Depending on
   the amount and dimensions of the GIF frames this might take a considerable
   amount of time. Better let GIFAnim.mcc use its default asynchronous parsing
   process and set up a notification for MUIA_GIFAnim_Decoded to perform any
   further action.

   Defaults to FALSE.

   SEE ALSO
   MUIA_GIFAnim_Decoded
GIFAnim.mcc/MUIA_GIFAnim_Transparent

   NAME
   MUIA_GIFAnim_Transparent -- [I..], BOOL

   FUNCTION
   Use the transparency mask, if available.

   Defaults to TRUE.
GIFAnim.mcc/MUIM_GIFAnim_First

    NAME
    MUIM_GIFAnim_First

    SYNOPSIS
    res = DoMethod(obj, MUIM_GIFAnim_First);

    FUNCTION
    Set the animation's first frame as current frame.

    RESULT
    res - TRUE if at least one frame was decoded, FALSE otherwise.
GIFAnim.mcc/MUIM_GIFAnim_Last

    NAME
    MUIM_GIFAnim_Last

    SYNOPSIS
    res = DoMethod(obj, MUIM_GIFAnim_Last);

    FUNCTION
    Set the animation's last frame as current frame.

    RESULT
    res - TRUE if at least one frame was decoded, FALSE otherwise.
GIFAnim.mcc/MUIM_GIFAnim_Next

    NAME
    MUIM_GIFAnim_Next

    SYNOPSIS
    res = DoMethod(obj, MUIM_GIFAnim_Next);

    FUNCTION
    Go to the next frame of the animation.

    RESULT
    res - TRUE if at least one frame was decoded, FALSE otherwise.
GIFAnim.mcc/MUIM_GIFAnim_Play

    NAME
    MUIM_GIFAnim_Play

    SYNOPSIS
    res = DoMethod(obj, MUIM_GIFAnim_Play, ULONG flags);

    FUNCTION
    Control the animation playback.

    INPUTS
    flags may be either:

     - MUIV_GIFAnim_Play_Off
       Pause the animation

    or an OR'ed combination of:

     - MUIV_GIFAnim_Play_Flags_Play
       Play the animation in a loop.

     - MUIV_GIFAnim_Play_Flags_Rewind
       In combination with MUIV_GIFAnim_Play_Flags_Play the animation will be
       played from the first frame. Otherwise the animation is played from the
       current frame without delay.

     - MUIV_GIFAnim_Play_Flags_PlayOnce
       Play the animation only once.

    EXAMPLES
    /* Play the animation, starting from the first frame */
    DoMethod(obj, MUIM_GIFAnim_Play,
        MUIV_GIFAnim_Play_Flags_Play|MUIV_GIFAnim_Play_Flags_Rewind);

    /* Stop the animation */
    DoMethod(obj, MUIM_GIFAnim_Play, MUIV_GIFAnim_Play_Off);


    RESULT
    res - TRUE if at least one frame was decoded, FALSE otherwise.
GIFAnim.mcc/MUIM_GIFAnim_Pred

    NAME
    MUIM_GIFAnim_Pred

    SYNOPSIS
    res = DoMethod(obj, MUIM_GIFAnim_Pred);

    FUNCTION
    Go the the previous frame of the animation.

    RESULT
    res - TRUE if at least one frame was decoded, FALSE otherwise.
