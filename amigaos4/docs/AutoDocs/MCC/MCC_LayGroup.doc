   LayGroup.mcc was originally developed by Alessandro Zummo and continued by
   LayGroup.mcc Open Source Team.
   This is an AmigaOS native reimplementation included in MUI for AmigaOS for
   convenience.

   LayGroup.mcc is a subclass of Virtgroup class which allows you to easily
   layout objects in a variable space. The user can change some settings through
   LayGroup.mcp. You can see the LayGroup demo to better understand this class.
   Starting with version 19.2, you can use every object as a child of this
   class, even if they have different vertical/horizontal sizes.

LayGroup.mcc/MUIA_Group_SameSize

   NAME
   MUIA_Group_SameSize -- (V19.2) [I..], BOOL

   FUNCTION
   Set this attribute to TRUE if and only if *ALL* child objects have exactly
   the same height and width. This will speed up the on screen layout.
   Defaults to FALSE.

   NOTES
   This is a standard MUI attribute, but the meaning is NOT the same. Be
   careful.

LayGroup.mcc/MUIA_LayGroup_AskLayout

   NAME
   MUIA_LayGroup_AskLayout -- [I..], BOOL

   FUNCTION
   Set this attribute to TRUE if you want to receive the MUIM_LayGroup_AskLayout
   method.
   Defaults to FALSE.

LayGroup.mcc/MUIA_LayGroup_ChildNumber

   NAME
   MUIA_LayGroup_ChildNumber -- [..G], ULONG

   FUNCTION
   This attribute returns the number of child objects in the LayGroup object.

   NOTES
   Doesn't work in pre 19.2 releases

LayGroup.mcc/MUIA_LayGroup_HorizSpacing

   NAME
   MUIA_LayGroup_HorizSpacing -- [ISG], LONG

   FUNCTION
   This attribute is used to choose the horizontal spacing between two objects.
   Using this attribute will override the user's settings.

LayGroup.mcc/MUIA_LayGroup_InheritBackground

   NAME
   MUIA_LayGroup_InheritBackground -- [I..], BOOL

   FUNCTION
   This attribute is used to force the LayGroup to leave the
   MUIA_Background tag empty, thus the user selected background will not be
   loaded.

LayGroup.mcc/MUIA_LayGroup_LeftOffset

   NAME
   MUIA_LayGroup_LeftOffset -- [ISG], LONG

   FUNCTION
   This attribute is used to choose the left offset between the object and its
   child objects. Using this attribute will override the user's settings.

LayGroup.mcc/MUIA_LayGroup_MaxHeight

   NAME
   MUIA_LayGroup_MaxHeight -- [I..], LONG (DONOTUSE)

   FUNCTION
   This attribute is used to inform the LayGroup about the maximum height of its
   child objects.

   SPECIAL INPUTS
   MUIV_LayGroup_MaxHeight_Auto
      LayGroup will automatically handle the thing

LayGroup.mcc/MUIA_LayGroup_MaxWidth

   NAME
   MUIA_LayGroup_MaxWidth -- [I..], LONG (DONOTUSE)

   FUNCTION
   This attribute is used to inform the LayGroup about the maximum width of its
   child objects.

   SPECIAL INPUTS
   MUIV_LayGroup_MaxWidth_Auto
      LayGroup will automatically handle the thing

LayGroup.mcc/MUIA_LayGroup_NumberOfColumns

   NAME
   MUIA_LayGroup_NumberOfColumns -- [..G], ULONG

   FUNCTION
   This attribute returns the number of columns in the LayGroup object.

   SEE ALSO
   MUIA_LayGroup_NumberOfRows

LayGroup.mcc/MUIA_LayGroup_NumberOfRows

   NAME
   MUIA_LayGroup_NumberOfRows -- [..G], ULONG

   FUNCTION
   This attribute returns the number of rows in the LayGroup object.

   SEE ALSO
   MUIA_LayGroup_NumberOfColumns

LayGroup.mcc/MUIA_LayGroup_Selection
   NAME
   MUIA_LayGroup_Selection -- (V19.4) [I..], ULONG

   FUNCTION
   This attribute allow to define selection type to use for a layout.
   Supported values are:
      MUIV_LayGroup_Selection_None
      MUIV_LayGroup_Selection_Immediate
   With immediate selection, CONTROL key can be pressed to enter a toggle
   selection mode.

LayGroup.mcc/MUIA_LayGroup_Spacing

   NAME
   MUIA_LayGroup_Spacing -- [IS.], LONG

   FUNCTION
   This attribute is used to choose both horizontal and vertical spacing between
   two objects. Using this attribute will override the user's settings.

LayGroup.mcc/MUIA_LayGroup_TopOffset

   NAME
   MUIA_LayGroup_TopOffset -- [ISG], LONG

   FUNCTION
   This attribute is used to choose the top offset between the object and its
   child objects. Using this attribute will override the user's settings.

LayGroup.mcc/MUIA_LayGroup_VertSpacing

   NAME
   MUIA_LayGroup_VertSpacing -- [ISG], LONG

   FUNCTION
   This attribute is used to choose the vertical spacing between two objects.
   Using this attribute will override the user's settings.

LayGroup.mcc/MUIM_LayGroup_AskLayout

   NAME
   MUIM_LayGroup_AskLayout -- (V19.2)

   SYNOPSIS
   DoMethod(obj, MUIM_LayGroup_AskLayout, struct MUI_LayGroup_Layout *lgl);

   FUNCTION
   If MUIA_LayGroup_AskLayout is TRUE and MUIA_Group_SameSize is FALSE, this
   method will be called to let the subclass define the width and height of a
   child object. This method will be called for each child object.

   INPUTS
   lgl - a pointer to a MUI_LayGroup_Layout structure:
       lgl_Object   - the object under examination
       lgl_Height   - the desired height of the object
       lgl_Width    - the desired width of the object

   RESULT
   Always return 0 for now.

   NOTES
   This method is for subclass authors only and therefore should not be called
   directly.

   EXAMPLE
   This is the default implementation of this method within LayGroup.mcc:

      ULONG ASM _AskLayout(REG(a0) struct IClass *cl, REG(a2) Object *obj, REG(a1) struct MUIP_LayGroup_AskLayout *al)
      {
         al->lgl->lgl_Width  = _defwidth(al->lgl->lgl_Object);
         al->lgl->lgl_Height = _defheight(al->lgl->lgl_Object);

         return 0;
      }
