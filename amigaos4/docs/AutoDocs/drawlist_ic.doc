    NAME
	drawlist.image - Drawlist image class.

    SUPERCLASS
	imageclass

    DESCRIPTION
	This image class can create custom scaled glyphs via a
	"drawlist". The drawlist is an array of drawing directives
	such as lines, areafills, etc. All coordinates are based
	on an imaginary grid of a user specified size, then
	ScalerDiv() is used to scale these coordinates to the desired
	image size to be rendered. This is a lower level class utilized
	by glyph.image.

	If you create some interesting drawlist, please consider passing
	them on to others or to us for inclusion.

    METHODS
	OM_NEW -- Create the drawlist image.
	          Passed to superclass then OM_SET.

	OM_GET -- Get object attributes. Passed to superclass first.

	OM_SET -- Set object attributes. Passed to superclass first.

	OM_UPDATE -- Set object notification attributes.
                Passed to superclass first.

	IM_DRAW -- Renders the image.

	IM_DRAWFRAME -- Renders the image scaled to frame size.

	All other methods are passed to the superclass.

    ATTRIBUTES
	DRAWLIST_Directives (struct DrawList *)
	    An array of drawlist directive structures are passed
	    to specify the vectors and render operation. The last
	    entry must be DLST_END.

	    struct DrawList
	    {
	        int16 dl_Directive;
	        int16 dl_X1, dl_Y1;
	        int16 dl_X2, dl_Y2;
	        int16 dl_Pen;
	    };

	    The following directives are supported:

	      DLST_END      - End the directive list
	      DLST_LINE     - Render line from (dl_x1, dl_y1) to (dl_x2, dl_y2)
	      DLST_RECT     - RectFill() of size (dl_x1, dl_y1, dl_x2, dl_y2)
	      DLST_LINEPAT  - Set the line pattern to value held in dl_Pen
	      DLST_FILLPAT  - Set the fill pattern to value held in dl_Pen
	      DLST_LINESIZE - Set the drawlist line thickness via dl_Pen
	      DLST_AMOVE    - AreaMove() using (dl_x1, dl_y1)
	      DLST_ADRAW    - AreaDraw() using (dl_x1, dl_y1)
	      DLST_AFILL    - Cause the AreaFill() operation
	      DLST_FILL     - Flood() an area
	      DLST_ELLIPSE  - AreaEllipse()
	      DLST_CIRCLE   - AreaCircle()
	      DLST_BEVELBOX - currently unsupported
	      DLST_ARC      - currently unsupported
	      DLST_START    - currently unsupported
	      DLST_BOUNDS   - currently unsupported

	    Defaults to NULL.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_UPDATE, OM_GET)

	DRAWLIST_RefHeight (int16)
	    Reference height of the drawlist imaginary grid.

	    Defaults to 50.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_UPDATE, OM_GET)

	DRAWLIST_RefWidth (int16)
	    Reference width of the drawlist imaginary grid.

	    Defaults to 50.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_UPDATE, OM_GET)
