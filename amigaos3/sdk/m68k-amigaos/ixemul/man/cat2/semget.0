     The sseemmggeett() system call returns the semaphore identifier associated with
     _k_e_y.

     A new set containing _n_s_e_m_s semaphores is created if either _k_e_y is equal
     to IPC_PRIVATE, or _k_e_y does not have a semaphore set associated with it,
     and the IPC_CREAT bit is set in _m_s_g_f_l_g_.

     If a new set of semaphores is created, the data structure associated with
     it (the _s_e_m_i_d___d_s structure, see semctl(2))  is intialized as follows:

     ++oo   _s_e_m___p_e_r_m_._c_u_i_d and _s_e_m___p_e_r_m_._u_i_d are set to the effective uid of the
         calling process.

     ++oo   _s_e_m___p_e_r_m_._g_i_d and _s_e_m___p_e_r_m_._c_g_i_d are set to the effective gid of the
         calling process.

     ++oo   _s_e_m___p_e_r_m_._m_o_d_e is set to the lower 9 bits of _m_s_g_f_l_g.

     ++oo   _s_e_m___n_s_e_m_s is set to the value of _n_s_e_m_s

     ++oo   _s_e_m___c_t_i_m_e is set to the current time

     ++oo   _s_e_m___o_t_i_m_e is set to 0

     sseemmggeett() returns a non-negative semaphore identifier if successful. Oth-
     erwise, -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to reflect the error.

EERRRROORRSS
     [EACCESS]     The caller has no permission to access a semaphore set al-
                   ready associated with _k_e_y_.

     [EEXIST]      Both IPC_CREAT and IPC_EXCL are set in _m_s_g_f_l_g, and a
                   semaphore set is already associated with _k_e_y.

     [EINVAL]      _n_s_e_m_s is less than 0 or greater than the system limit for
                   the number in a semaphore set.

                   A semaphore set associated with _k_e_y exists, but has fewer
                   semaphores than the number specified in _n_s_e_m_s.

     [ENOSPC]      A new set of semaphores could not be created because the
                   system limit for the number of semaphores or the number of
                   semaphore sets has been reached.

     [ENOENT]      IPC_CREAT was not set in _m_s_g_f_l_g and no semaphore set asso-
                   ciated with _k_e_y was found.
