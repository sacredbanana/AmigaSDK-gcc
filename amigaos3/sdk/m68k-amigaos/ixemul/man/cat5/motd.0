     The file _/_e_t_c_/_m_o_t_d is normally displayed by login(1) after a user has
     logged in but before the shell is run.  It is generally used for impor-
     tant system-wide announcements.  During system startup, a line containing
     the kernel version string is prepended to this file.

     Individual users may suppress the display of this file by creating a file
     named ``_._h_u_s_h_l_o_g_i_n'' in their home directories.
