     ggrroouupp - format of the group permissions file

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The file <_/_e_t_c_/_g_r_o_u_p> consists of newline separated ASCII records, one
     per group, containing four colon `:' separated fields. These fields are
     as follows:
           group     Name of the group.
           passwd    Group's _e_n_c_r_y_p_t_e_d password.
           gid       The group's decimal ID.
           member    Group members.

     The _g_r_o_u_p field is the group name used for granting file access to users
     who are members of the group.  The _g_i_d field is the number associated
     with the group name.  They should both be unique across the system (and
     often across a group of systems) since they control file access.  The
     _p_a_s_s_w_d field is an optional _e_n_c_r_y_p_t_e_d password.  This field is rarely
     used and an asterisk is normally placed in it rather than leaving it
     blank.  The _m_e_m_b_e_r field contains the names of users granted the privi-
     leges of _g_r_o_u_p. The member names are separated by commas without spaces
     or newlines.  A user is automatically in a group if that group was speci-
     fied in their _/_e_t_c_/_p_a_s_s_w_d entry and does not need to be added to that
     group in the _/_e_t_c_/_g_r_o_u_p _f_i_l_e_.

YYPP SSUUPPPPOORRTT
     If YP is active, the ggrroouupp file may also contain lines of the format

     +name:*::

     which causes the specified group to be included from the _g_r_o_u_p_._b_y_n_a_m_e YP
     map.

     If no group name is specified, or the ``+'' (plus sign) appears alone on
     line, all groups are included from the YP map.

     YP references may appear anywhere in the file, but the single ``+'' form
     should be on the last line, for historical reasons.  Only the first group
     with a specific name encountered, whether in the ggrroouupp file itself, or
     included via YP, will be used.

     A ggrroouupp file format appeared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.

     YP file format first appeared in SunOS.
