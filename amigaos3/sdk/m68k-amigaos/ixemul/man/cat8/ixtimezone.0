       _I_x_t_i_m_e_z_o_n_e uses the TTZZ environment variable  to  determine
       the  offset  in seconds between Universal Coordinated Time
       (aka Greenwich Mean Time) and  the  local  timezone.  This
       offset  is  stored  in a field in the ixemul library base.
       The offset is also written  to  the  environment  variable
       IIXXGGMMTTOOFFFFSSEETT.   The _i_x_e_m_u_l_._l_i_b_r_a_r_y is now able to correctly
       determine the local time and GMT.

       The TTZZ environment variable should contain the name of one
       of  the files in the //eettcc//zzoonneeiinnffoo directory. For example,
       I live in the Netherlands, so my TTZZ is set to  EEuurrooppee//AAmmss--
       tteerrddaamm.   The  TTZZ  environment variable _m_u_s_t be set before
       using _i_x_t_i_m_e_z_o_n_e, otherwise _i_x_t_i_m_e_z_o_n_e wouldn't know  what
       the  local  timezone is, and therefore it wouldn't be able
       to compute the offset from GMT.

       You should put  _i_x_t_i_m_e_z_o_n_e  in  your  ssttaarrttuupp--sseeqquueennccee  to
       ensure  that  it  is called every time you start your com-
       puter. After _i_x_t_i_m_e_z_o_n_e has been executed, you can set  TTZZ
       to  whatever value you want. For example, to see what time
       it is in Japan, set TTZZ to JJaappaann and type _i_x_t_i_m_e_z_o_n_e _-_t_e_s_t.
       But  don't  use any other option, as the other options set
       the GMT offset based on the current  TTZZ  value,  which  is
       JJaappaann!

       Note  that  you  need  to  call this tool at least twice a
       year, when Daylight Saving Time comes in effect  and  when
       it ends.

       --tteesstt  Print   the   local  time  and  GMT  (according  to
              _i_x_e_m_u_l_._l_i_b_r_a_r_y) to standard output.   Use  this  to
              test  the  current settings. It doesn't affect any-
              thing else.

       --ggeett--ooffffsseett
              Calculate the difference between local time and GMT
              in  seconds.  The resulting offset is stored in the
              library base of _i_x_e_m_u_l_._l_i_b_r_a_r_y and is also  written
              to the global environment variable IIXXGGMMTTOOFFFFSSEETT.

              If  the  IIXXGGMMTTOOFFFFSSEETT  environment  variable  didn't
              exist or the offset stored in the original environ-
              ment  variable  differed from the new offset (which
              happens when Daylight Saving Time starts or  ends),
              then  a  copy  of  IIXXGGMMTTOOFFFFSSEETT  is  written  to the



                                                                1

              EENNVVAARRCC:: directory.

              Since _i_x_e_m_u_l_._l_i_b_r_a_r_y reads the IIXXGGMMTTOOFFFFSSEETT environ-
              ment  variable just after it is loaded into memory,
              it is sufficient to use _i_x_t_i_m_e_z_o_n_e only  when  Day-
              light  Saving  Time  starts  or  ends. Provided, of
              course, that the contents of the EENNVVAARRCC::  directory
              is  copied to EENNVV:: before _i_x_e_m_u_l_._l_i_b_r_a_r_y is loaded.

       --cchheecckk--ddsstt
              This option does the same as  --ggeett--ooffffsseett,  but  it
              also detects if Daylight Saving Time has started or
              ended. If so, it automatically sets the Amiga clock
              to  the  correct  time.  So  you  no longer need to
              change the time manually twice a year.

       --ppaattcchh--rreessoouurrccee
              This option does the same as  --ggeett--ooffffsseett,  but  it
              also  patches the _b_a_t_t_c_l_o_c_k_._r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e.  This is most
              useful if you also run the Unix operating system on
              your  Amiga  (NetBSD  or  Linux, for example). Unix
              requires that the clock is set  to  Greenwich  Mean
              Time,  while  the  Amiga requires that the clock is
              set   to    local    time.    By    patching    the
              _b_a_t_t_c_l_o_c_k_._r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e  one  can  set  the Amiga clock,
              which is managed by the _b_a_t_t_c_l_o_c_k_._r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e, to  GMT
              time.  The  patch  ensures  that whenever the Amiga
              wants to obtain the time, the GMT time is converted
              into  local  time. There is also no longer any need
              to change the Amiga clock when Daylight Saving Time
              starts  or  ends, since the battery clock is set to
              GMT.

              _i_x_t_i_m_e_z_o_n_e  detects  if  you  try  to   patch   the
              _b_a_t_t_c_l_o_c_k_._r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e  a  second  time. It won't patch
              the resource again, but it will check if  the  cur-
              rent GMT offset is still the same as when the patch
              was originally installed. If it  has  changed,  the
              _b_a_t_t_c_l_o_c_k_._r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e offset will also be changed.

       --rreemmoovvee--ppaattcchh
              Removes  the _b_a_t_t_c_l_o_c_k_._r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e patch. It checks if
              the patch was really installed before removing  it.
              This option doesn't do anything else.

       The original idea for the --ppaattcchh--rreessoouurrccee option came from
       the  _u_n_i_x_c_l_o_c_k  utility  written  by  Geert  Uytterhoeven.
       _u_n_i_x_c_l_o_c_k is available on Aminet.
