     The ffttookk() function attempts to create a unique key suitable for use with
     the msgget(2),  semget(2) and shmget(2) functions given the _p_a_t_h of an
     existing file and a user-selectable _i_d.

     The specified _p_a_t_h must specify an existing file that is accessible to
     the calling process or the call will fail.  Also, note that links to
     files will return the same key, given the same _i_d.

     The ffttookk() function will return -1 if _p_a_t_h does not exist or if it cannot
     be accessed by the calling process.

     The ffttookk() function originate with System V and is typically used by pro-
     grams that use the System V IPC routines.

BBUUGGSS
     The returned key is computed based on the device and inode of the speci-
     fied _p_a_t_h in combination with the given _i_d. Thus is is quite possible for
     the routine to return duplicate keys given that those fields are not 8-
     and 16-bit quantities like they were on System V based systems where this
     library routine's ancestor were originally created.
