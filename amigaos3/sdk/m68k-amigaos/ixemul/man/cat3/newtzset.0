       _T_z_s_e_t uses the value of the environment variable TTZZ to set
       time conversion information used by _l_o_c_a_l_t_i_m_e.  If TTZZ does
       not appear in the environment, the best available approxi-
       mation to local wall  clock  time,  as  specified  by  the
       _t_z_f_i_l_e(5)-format file llooccaallttiimmee in the system time conver-
       sion information directory, is used by _l_o_c_a_l_t_i_m_e.   If  TTZZ
       appears in the environment but its value is a null string,
       Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)  is  used  (without  leap
       second  correction).  If TTZZ appears in the environment and
       its value is not a null string:

              if the value begins with a colon, it is used  as  a
              pathname of a file from which to read the time con-
              version information;

              if the value does not begin with  a  colon,  it  is
              first  used as the pathname of a file from which to
              read the time conversion information, and, if  that
              file cannot be read, is used directly as a specifi-
              cation of the time conversion information.

       When TTZZ is used as a pathname, if it begins with a  slash,
       it  is used as an absolute pathname; otherwise, it is used
       as a pathname relative to a system time conversion  infor-
       mation  directory.   The file must be in the format speci-
       fied in _t_z_f_i_l_e(5).

       When TTZZ is used directly as a specification  of  the  time
       conversion  information, it must have the following syntax
       (spaces inserted for clarity):

              _s_t_d_o_f_f_s_e_t[_d_s_t[_o_f_f_s_e_t][,,_r_u_l_e]]

       Where:

              _s_t_d and _d_s_t    Three or more  bytes  that  are  the
                             designation  for  the standard (_s_t_d)
                             or summer (_d_s_t) time zone.  Only _s_t_d
                             is required; if _d_s_t is missing, then
                             summer time does not apply  in  this
                             locale.   Upper-  and lowercase let-
                             ters are  explicitly  allowed.   Any
                             characters  except  a  leading colon
                             (::), digits, comma (,,),  minus  (--),
                             plus (++), and ASCII NUL are allowed.



                                                                1

              _o_f_f_s_e_t         Indicates the value one must add  to
                             the  local time to arrive at Coordi-
                             nated Universal  Time.   The  _o_f_f_s_e_t
                             has the form:

                                    _h_h[::_m_m[::_s_s]]

                             The  minutes  (_m_m)  and seconds (_s_s)
                             are  optional.   The  hour  (_h_h)  is
                             required  and may be a single digit.
                             The   _o_f_f_s_e_t   following   _s_t_d    is
                             required.  If no _o_f_f_s_e_t follows _d_s_t,
                             summer time is  assumed  to  be  one
                             hour ahead of standard time.  One or
                             more digits may be used;  the  value
                             is  always  interpreted as a decimal
                             number.  The hour  must  be  between
                             zero  and  24,  and the minutes (and
                             seconds) -- if  present  --  between
                             zero  and  59.   If  preceded  by  a
                             ``--'', the time zone shall  be  east
                             of  the Prime Meridian; otherwise it
                             shall be west (which  may  be  indi-
                             cated   by   an  optional  preceding
                             ``++'').

              _r_u_l_e           Indicates when to change to and back
                             from  summer time.  The _r_u_l_e has the
                             form:

                                    _d_a_t_e//_t_i_m_e,,_d_a_t_e//_t_i_m_e

                             where the first _d_a_t_e describes  when
                             the  change  from standard to summer
                             time  occurs  and  the  second  _d_a_t_e
                             describes  when the change back hap-
                             pens.   Each  _t_i_m_e  field  describes
                             when,  in  current  local  time, the
                             change to the other time is made.

                             The format of _d_a_t_e  is  one  of  the
                             following:

                                       is,  in   all   years   --
                                       including  leap  years  --
                                       February 28 is day 59  and
                                       March  1 is day 60.  It is
                                       impossible  to  explicitly
                                       refer  to  the  occasional
                                       February 29.




                                                                2

                             _n         The zero-based Julian  day
                                       (0 <= _n <= 365).      Leap
                                       days are counted,  and  it
                                       is  possible  to  refer to
                                       February 29.

                             MM_m.._n.._d    The _d_'th day (0 <= _d <= 6)
                                       of  week  _n  of month _m of
                                       the   year   (1 <= _n <= 5,
                                       1 <= _m <= 12, where week 5
                                       means ``the last _d day  in
                                       month  _m'' which may occur
                                       in either  the  fourth  or
                                       the  fifth  week).  Week 1
                                       is the first week in which
                                       the  _d_'th day occurs.  Day
                                       zero is Sunday.

                             The _t_i_m_e has the same format as _o_f_f_-
                             _s_e_t  except  that  no  leading  sign
                             (``--'' or ``++'')  is  allowed.   The
                             default,  if  _t_i_m_e  is not given, is
                             0022::0000::0000.

       If no _r_u_l_e is present in TTZZ, the rules  specified  by  the
       _t_z_f_i_l_e(5)-format  file  ppoossiixxrruulleess in the system time con-
       version information directory are used, with the  standard
       and  summer time offsets from UTC replaced by those speci-
       fied by the _o_f_f_s_e_t values in TTZZ.

       For compatibility with System V Release 3.1,  a  semicolon
       (;;)  may be used to separate the _r_u_l_e from the rest of the
       specification.

       If  the  TTZZ  environment  variable  does  not  specify   a
       _t_z_f_i_l_e(5)-format  and  cannot  be  interpreted as a direct
       specification, UTC is used.
