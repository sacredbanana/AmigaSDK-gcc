;* PutProc is actually a function pointer, but due to different compilers
;* and conventions defined here as a void *. It is called with the
;* character to print in d0, the user data in a1 and a3 and the user
;* base in a4. This is most useful for C code.

;* The library functions are interrupt-callable, provided your PutProc
;* is.
