The amiga.lib and small.lib link libraries have shipped with NDKs since at
least the Kickstart/Workbench 1.3 days. It may be worth repeating what
purpose small.lib serves.

If you have linked your software against amiga.lib before you might want to
consider switching to small.lib instead because it is much smaller and modern
Amiga 'C' compilers (Lattice 'C' version 4 as well as Aztec 'C' version 5,
1990 and beyond) no longer need the function call stub code which gives
amiga.lib its bulk.
