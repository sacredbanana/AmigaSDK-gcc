    NAME
	text.datatype -- Root class type to display textual data.

    FUNCTION
	The text.datatype is the super-class for any text related classes.

    METHODS
	OM_NEW -- Create a new text object.

	OM_UPDATE -- adjusts attributes of the object. The method is of type
	    struct opSet *, and the following attributes are currently
	    supported:
	    DTA_TopVert:	line number of the topmost line
	    DTA_TopHoriz:	column number of the first visible column
	    DTA_VisibleVert:	number of visible lines 
	    DTA_VisibleHoriz:	numer of visible columns
	    DTA_Sync:		if the tag value is non-zero, re-renders
	    			the contents
	    TDTA_Buffer:	pointer to an AllocVec()'d buffer containing
	    			the text to show. Lifetime managenemt of the
				buffer is within the datatype.
	    TDTA_BufferLen:	size of the buffer
	    TDTA_WordWrap:	currently ignored and reserved.
	    TDTA_WordDelim:	Pointer to a NUL-terminated string that
	    			contains all ISO-Latin-1 characters that
				delimit words. Used for word-selection and
				clipboard handling. By default, this string
				is "\t *-,()<>[];\""
	    
	OM_SET -- identical to OM_UPDATE.

	OM_GET -- retrieves attributes from an object. In addition to the
	    attributes supported by OM_SET, the following attributes can
	    also be retrieved:

	    DTA_TextAttr:	Pointer to a struct TTextAttr that defines
	    			the font used for rendering the text.
	    DTA_TextFont:	Pointer to a struct TextFont used for
	    			rendering.
	    DTA_ObjName:	Name of the file or source that is currently
	    			being displayed.
	    DTA_Methods:	Pointer to an array of methods supported by
	    			the datatype.
	    DTA_TriggerMethods:	Pointer to an array of struct DTMethods that
	    			indicates which additional trigger methods
				are supported by the object, and are potentially
				shown in a menu, e.g. in MultiView. Currently,
				the object supports STM_SEARCH, STM_SEARCH_NEXT
				and STM_SEARCH_PREV.

	GM_RENDER -- re-render the contents of the text window.

	DTM_PROCLAYOUT -- Layout (remap) the text in the context of the caller.

	GM_LAYOUT -- identical to DTM_PROCLAYOUT

	GM_GOACTIVE -- tell the object to become active.

	GM_HANDLEINPUT -- processes user interaction.

	DTM_CLEARSELECTED -- resets the selected text region.

	DTM_COPY -- copies the selected text areas into the clipboard.

	DTM_WRITE -- writes the contents into a file or a clipboard. The
	    message is of type "struct dtWrite *". If dtw_Mode is DTWM_RAW
	    and dtw_FileHandle is set, the text is written "as is" into the
	    given file.
	    If dtw_Mode is DTWM_IFF, the file is written as IFF TEXT into
	    the file given in dtw_FileHandle.

	DTM_PRINT -- print the text, the method is of type "struct dtPrint *"
	    and dtp_PIO points to an IORequest over which the text is written.

	DTM_REMOVEDTOBJECT -- removes the seach window GUI.

	DTM_TRIGGER -- triggers user-initiated functions on the object. The
	    method is of type struct dtTrigger *, and dtt_Function is one
	    of the following:
	    STM_ACTIVATE_FIELD,STM_RETRACE,STM_SEARCH: Shows the search window,
	    allowing the user to enter a string to be searched.
	    STM_PREV_FIELD,STM_BROWSE_PREV,STM_SEARCH_PREV: Searches the
	    previous occurance of the user provided string.
	    STM_NEXT_FIELD,STM_BROWSE_NEXT,STM_SEARCH_NEXT: Searches the
	    next occurance of the user provided string.

	OM_DISPOSE -- Dispose the object.
