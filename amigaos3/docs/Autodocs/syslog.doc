   NAME
	SysLog - a system-wide system-friendly system logger

   Background
	SysLog is a ROM module that is activated by System-Startup
	whenever the user selects the Debug option in the boot menu.
	Its purpose is to collect information that would otherwise
	go through the serial port at 9600-8N1 and place this
	data in RAM:syslog.
	As System-Startup also sets the shell variable $DEBUG to 1,
	the boot shell activity is also logged through SysLog.
	Note that many debugging tools use this serial port protocol
	to output debugging data, which will be automatically
	collected by this ROM module, and made available.

	Syslog can be seen as a poor men's ROM version of popular
	debugging tools such as Sashimi.

	The RAM:syslog file is opened only when extending the log,
	it can thus be deleted when its contents is no longer
	required. SysLog will re-create it whenever new logging
	data comes in.
