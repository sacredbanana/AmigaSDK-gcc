    NAME
        led.image--Simulated LED display image.                 (V42)
 
    SUPERCLASS
        imageclass
 
    DESCRIPTION
        The led.image image class provides a simulated LED image display.
 
    METHODS
        OM_NEW--Create the LED image.  Passed to superclass, then OM_SET.
 
        OM_SET--Set object attributes.  Passed to superclass first.
 
        OM_UPDATE--Set object notification attributes.  Passed to superclass
            first.
 
        IM_DRAW--Renders the images.  Overrides the superclass.
 
        All other methods are passed to the superclass, including OM_DISPOSE.
 
    ATTRIBUTES
        SYSIA_DrawInfo (struct DrawInfo *) -- Contains important pen
            information.  This is required if IA_BGPen and IA_FGPen are
            not specified.
 
        IA_FGPen (LONG) -- Pen to use to draw the lit segments.  If -1
            is specified then TEXTPEN is used.
 
        IA_BGPen (LONG) -- Pen to use to draw the unlit segments or
            background.  If -1 is specified then BACKGROUNDPEN is used.
            Ignored prior to V47.
 
        IA_Width (LONG) -- Width of the image.
 
        IA_Height (LONG) -- Height of the image.
 
        LED_Pairs (LONG) -- Number of pairs of digits.
 
        LED_Values (WORD *) -- Array of values.  One entry per pair
            is required.

        LED_Colon (BOOL) -- Is the colon between pairs lit or not.
            Defaults to FALSE.
 
        LED_Negative (BOOL) -- Is the negative sign lit or not.
            Defaults to FALSE.

        LED_Signed (BOOL) -- Leave room for a negative sign or
            not.  Defaults to FALSE.

        LED_Time (BOOL) -- Leave space for a colon or not. Defaults to
            TRUE. (V47.3)

        LED_Hexadecimal (BOOL) -- Hexadecimal instead of decimal output.
            Defaults to FALSE. (V47.3)

        LED_Raw (BOOL) -- Raw mode; allows arbitrary combinations of segments
            to be lit. In this mode, each byte of the array at LED_Values
            is interpreted as follows (on bits are lit, off bits are unlit):

            bit 7: currently ignored
            bit 6: top
            bit 5: top left
            bit 4: top right
            bit 3: middle
            bit 2: bottom left
            bit 1: bottom right
            bit 0: bottom

            The high byte of each word pertains to the left digit of the
            pair, and the low byte pertains to the right digit.

            Eg. to form a lowercase "ab", a value of $5F2F would be used.
            (V47.3)
