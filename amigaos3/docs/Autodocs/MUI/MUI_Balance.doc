Balance.mui/Balance.mui
	The Balance class is very simple. Inserting objects of this class somewhere in
	your group (only horizontal or vertical groups, nothing 2-dimensional) allows
	your users to dynamically change the weight of your children.

	Since MUI5 2018R1 (muimaster.library 21.121) Balance class implements the
	additional features of BetterBalance.mcc. This means that the user can save
	and restore the balanced weights of the neighboring objects for each Balance
	object with a unique MUIA_ObjectID during MUIM_Application_Save and
	MUIM_Application_Load.

	Something like this will automatically restore and save the weights of the two
	Rectangle objects:

	HGroup,
	  Child, RectangleObject, TextFrame, End,
	  Child, BalanceObject, MUIA_ObjectID, 0x12345678, End,
	  Child, RectangleObject, TextFrame, End,
	End,

	// restore the formerly saved weights before the window is opened
	DoMethod(app, MUIM_Application_Load, MUIV_Application_Load_ENV);

	[... main loop ...]

	// save the current weight upon application termination
	DoMethod(app, MUIM_Application_Save, MUIV_Application_Save_ENV);

	Of course the application might override MUIM_Application_SnapshotWindow to save
	the weight during snapshotting the window or provide a special "Save" button for
	that purpose.

	Refer to the source of the Balancing demo for more details.
