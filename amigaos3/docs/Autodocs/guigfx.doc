    NAME
        AddPaletteA - add a palette's colors to a pen-sharemap.
        AddPalette  - varargs stub for AddPaletteA.

    SYNOPSIS
        colorhandle = AddPaletteA(psm,palette,taglist)
        d0                        a0  a1      a2

        APTR AddPaletteA(APTR,APTR,struct TagItem *)
        
        APTR AddPalette(APTR,APTR,tag,...,TAG_DONE)

    FUNCTION
        This function adds a palette's colors to a pen-sharemap.

    INPUTS
        psm         - pointer to a pen-sharemap
        palette     - pointer to a color table
        tags        - pointer to an array of TagItems

    TAGS
        GGFX_PaletteFormat (ULONG) - format of the palette. Currently
                defined are:
                      
                PALFMT_RGB8
                        ULONG 0x00rrggbb

                PALFMT_RGB32
                        ULONG red,green,blue. This is the LoadRGB32()
                        format without trailing longword.

                Default: PALFMT_RGB8
                
        GGFX_NumColors (ULONG) - number of colors in the color table.
                Currently, this argument is mandatory. Default: 0
        
        GGFX_Weight (ULONG) - weight factor. Valid range: 1...255.
                With this factor, you can specify a significance
                for this color instance. The higher this value, the
                higher the palette's influence on the pen-sharemap.
                Default: 1

    RESULTS
        colorhandle - identifier for a particular dependency between
                      color information and pen-sharemap. there is
                      no need for you to store a colorhandle, unless
                      you want to manually remove it from the pen-sharemap
                      via RemColorHandle(). NULL if something went wrong.

    NOTES
        An example is provided with the documentation for AddPictureA().

    NAME
        AddPictureA - add a picture's color information to a pen-sharemap.
        AddPicture  - varargs stub for AddPictureA.

    SYNOPSIS

        d0                        a0  a1      a2

        APTR AddPictureA(APTR,APTR,struct TagItem *)
        
        APTR AddPicture(APTR,APTR,tag,...,TAG_DONE)

    FUNCTION
        This function adds a picture's color information to
        a pen-sharemap.

    INPUTS
        psm         - pointer to a pen-sharemap
        picture     - pointer to a picture
        tags        - pointer to an array of TagItems

    TAGS
        GGFX_Weight (ULONG) - weight factor. Valid range: 1...255.
                With this factor, you can specify a significance
                for this color instance. The higher this value, the
                higher the picture's influence on the pen-sharemap.
                Default: 1
        
    RESULTS
        colorhandle - identifier for a particular dependency between
                      color information and pen-sharemap. there is
                      no need for you to store a colorhandle, unless
                      you want to manually remove it from the pen-sharemap
                      via RemColorHandle(). NULL if something went wrong.

    EXAMPLE
        Assume there were three different pictures to be drawn.

        a) a noisy background
        b) a logo of your company
        c) navigation icons

        you might want to differenciate the significances for these 
        pictures as follows:

        AddPicture(psm, backpic, GGFX_Weight, 2, TAG_DONE);
        AddPicture(psm, logopic, GGFX_Weight, 3, TAG_DONE);
        AddPicture(psm, navpic, GGFX_Weight, 5, TAG_DONE);

        the backpic's influence on the allocated pens would be 20%, the logo
        contributed with 30%, and the navigation buttons would be taken into
        account with 50% then.

                                    Tag,...,TAG_DONE)

    FUNCTION
        Derive a handle from a drawhandle for highly optimized
        ('direct') drawing function calls. Currently only truecolor
        data (PIXFMT_0RGB_32) are supported.

    INPUTS
        drawhandle   - drawhandle from which to derive a directdrawhandle
        sourcewidth  - source width [pixels]
        sourceheight - source height [rows]
        destwidth    - dest width [pixels]
        destheight   - dest height [rows]
        tags         - pointer to an array of TagItems

    TAGS
        GGFX_PixelFormat - type of pixels to be processed. Currently
             only PIXFMT_0RGB_32 is supported.
             Default: PIXFMT_0RGB_32

    RESULTS
         ddh   - a direct-drawhandle, an object that can be passed
                 to DirectDrawTrueColorA()

    NOTES
         You must free the direct-drawhandle with a matching call
         to DeleteDirectDrawHandle(). You are not allowed to free
         the underlying drawhandle before the direct-drawhandle.
         The consequences might be fatal.

    NAME
        CreatePenShareMapA - create a screen-pen manager.
        CreatePenShareMap  - varargs stub for CreatePenShareMapA.

    SYNOPSIS
        psm = CreatePenShareMapA(taglist)
        d0                       a0

        APTR CreatePenShareMapA(struct TagItem *)
        
        APTR CreatePenShareMap(tag,...,TAG_DONE)

    FUNCTION
        This function creates a screen-pen manager.

    INPUTS
        tags        - pointer to an array of TagItems

    TAGS
        GGFX_HSType (ULONG) - internal histogram type, according to
                the histogram types defined in render/render.h.
                Better you never touch this tag, unless you know exactly
                what you are doing. Also consider reading the 'memory' text
                file supplied with the render.library distribution.
                Default: HSTYPE_12BIT_TURBO
        
    RESULTS
        psm   - a pen-sharemap ready for usage or NULL if there was not
                enough memory available.

    NOTES
        The term 'pen-sharemap' might be confusing and has been
        maintained for consistency reasons. It is actually a
        histogram that collects color statistics. When a
        pen-sharemap is passed to ObtainDrawHandleA(), it allows
        to calculate a very specific palette.

        struct BitMap *CreatePictureBitMapA(APTR,APTR,struct TagItem *)

        struct BitMap *CreatePictureBitMap(APTR,APTR,tag,...,TAG_DONE)

    FUNCTION
        This function creates a BitMap from a drawhandle and from
        a picture. This BitMap will be applicable to the drawhandle's
        RastPort and ColorMap, i.e. it may use colors allocated with
        the drawhandle, and can be blitted efficiently to the RastPort
        with graphics.library functions.
        
        If the picture argument is ommitted (i.e. NULL), then this
        function creates a blank, displayable BitMap that can be
        blitted efficiently to the drawhandle's RastPort. Note: The
        tags GGFX_DestWidth and GGFX_DestHeight are mandatory if no
        picture is specified, and all other tags will be ignored. (v15)
        
        Note: The BitMap structure must be freed with
        graphics.library/FreeBitMap().

    INPUTS
        drawhandle  - pointer to a drawhandle from ObtainDrawHandleA()
        picture     - pointer to a picture, or NULL.

                Mandatory if no picture is supplied.
                Default: the picture's width.

        GGFX_DestHeight (ULONG)
                destination height for the BitMap [rows].
                Mandatory if no picture is supplied.
                Default: the picture's height.

        GGFX_SourceX (ULONG)
                left edge inside the picture where to fetch the pixels
                from [pixels]. Default: 0.

        GGFX_SourceY (ULONG)
                top edge inside the picture where to fetch the pixels
                from [rows]. Default: 0.

        GGFX_SourceWidth (ULONG)
                width of an area inside the picture [pixels].
                Default: The picture's width.

        GGFX_SourceHeight (ULONG)
                height of an area inside the picture [rows].
                Default: The picture's height.

        GGFX_CallBackHook (struct Hook *)
                pointer to a callback Hook structure. The associated
                callback function will be called from time to time
                while the picture is being rendered to the BitMap.
                The callback has to return TRUE for continuation or FALSE
                for abortion. It will be submitted a pointer to the
                picture for the object, and a message of the following
                type:

                        ULONG GGFX_MSGTYPE_LINEDRAWN
                        ULONG line_number

                DITHERMODE_EDD
                        EDD dithering. This mode is faster than
                        Floyd-Steinberg dithering.
 
                Default: The drawhandle's dithermode.

        GGFX_DitherAmount (ULONG) - dither amount. Valid range: 0...255.

    NAME
        CreatePictureMaskA - create a mask from a picture. (v15)
        CreatePictureMask  - varargs stub for CreatePictureMaskA.

    SYNOPSIS
        success = CreatePictureMaskA(picture,array,bytewidth,tags)

        BOOL CreatePictureMaskA(APTR,UBYTE *,UWORD,struct TagItem *)

        BOOL CreatePictureMask(APTR,UBYTE *,UWORD,tag,...,TAG_DONE)

    FUNCTION
        This function creates a single-bitplane mask from a picture's
        alpha-channel. This mask can be passed to e.g.
        graphics.library/BltMaskBitMapRastPort() for masked blitting.
        
        If the picture contains no alpha-channel, the resulting
        mask will be completely opaque, i.e. all bits will be set.
        
        Use GGFX_Ratio to specify a threshold. Alpha-channel values
        below this threshold will be rendered to a clear bit, values
        greater or equal to a set bit.
        
        The array argument must point to a single bitplane, with an
        alignment according to ((width+15)>>4)<<1. The bytewidth must
        be an even number.
        
        Optionally, the alpha-channel is scaled to the resulting
        bitplane.

    INPUTS
        picture     - pointer to a picture
        array       - pointer to a single bitplane. reserve at least
                      (((width+15)>>4)<<1)*height bytes.
        bytewidth   - total width of the bitplane array [bytes]
        tags        - pointer to an array of TagItems

    TAGS
        GGFX_DestWidth (ULONG)
                destination width to be used in the resulting
                bitplane [pixels]. Default: the picture's width.

        GGFX_DestHeight (ULONG)
                destination height to be used in the resulting
                bitplane [rows]. Default: the picture's height.

        GGFX_SourceX (ULONG)
                left edge inside the picture where to fetch the
                alpha-channel from [pixels]. Default: 0.

        GGFX_SourceY (ULONG)
                top edge inside the picture where to fetch the
                alpha-channel from [rows]. Default: 0.

        GGFX_SourceWidth (ULONG)
                width of an area inside the picture [pixels].
                Default: The picture's width.

        GGFX_SourceHeight (ULONG)
                height of an area inside the picture [rows].
                Default: The picture's height.

        GGFX_Ratio (ULONG) - threshold. Alpha-channel values
                greater or equal this threshold will appear as
                a set bit. Default: 128

    RESULTS
        success    - boolean, FALSE if there was not enough
                     memory for intermediate buffers

                each. They form a trapezoid inside the current picture
                for the texture picture to be mapped to. border clipping

    NAME
        DrawPictureA - draw a picture to a drawhandle.
        DrawPicture  - varargs stub for DrawPictureA.

    SYNOPSIS
        success = DrawPictureA(drawhandle,picture,x, y, tags)
        d0                     a0         a1      d0 d1 a2

        BOOL DrawPictureA(APTR,APTR,UWORD,UWORD,struct TagItem *)

        BOOL DrawPicture(APTR,APTR,UWORD,UWORD,tag,...,TAG_DONE)

    FUNCTION
        This function draws a picture to the RastPort associated with
        a drawhandle. Optionally, the picture will be scaled to the
        specified dimensions. A clip area inside the picture may be
        specified as well.

    INPUTS
        drawhandle  - pointer to a drawhandle from ObtainDrawHandleA()
        picture     - pointer to a picture
        x           - left edge inside the RastPort [pixels]
        y           - top edge inside the RastPort [rows]
        tags        - pointer to an array of TagItems

    TAGS
        GGFX_SourceX (ULONG)
                left edge inside the picture where to fetch the pixels
                from [pixels]. Default: 0.

        GGFX_SourceY (ULONG)
                top edge inside the picture where to fetch the pixels
                from [rows]. Default: 0.

        GGFX_SourceWidth (ULONG)
                width of an area inside the picture [pixels].
                Default: The picture's width.

        GGFX_SourceHeight (ULONG)
                height of an area inside the picture [rows].
                Default: The picture's height.

        GGFX_DestWidth (ULONG)
                destination width for the picture to be drawn [pixels].
                Default: the picture's width.

        GGFX_DestHeight (ULONG)
                destination height for the picture to be drawn [rows].
                Default: the picture's height.

        GGFX_CallBackHook (struct Hook *)
                pointer to a callback Hook structure. The associated
                callback function will be called from time to time
                while the picture is being drawn.
                The callback has to return TRUE for continuation or FALSE
                for abortion. It will be submitted a pointer to the
                picture for the object, and a message of the following
                type:

                        ULONG GGFX_MSGTYPE_LINEDRAWN
                        ULONG line_number
                
                Also refer to the example below.
                Default: NULL.

        GGFX_DitherMode (ULONG) - dither mode. Currently available are:

                DITHERMODE_NONE
                        no dithering at all
                
                DITHERMODE_FS
                        Floyd-Steinberg dithering
                        
                DITHERMODE_RANDOM
                        Random dithering. This mode is significantly
                        slower than Floyd-Steinberg dithering.

                DITHERMODE_EDD
                        EDD dithering. This mode is faster than
                        Floyd-Steinberg dithering.
                        
                Default: The drawhandle's dithermode.

        GGFX_DitherAmount (ULONG) - dither amount. Valid range: 0...255.
                Currently, this value is of any use only for
                DITHERMODE_RANDOM. Default: The drawhandle's dither amount.

        GGFX_AutoDither (BOOL) - automatic dither activation.
                temporarily overrides the drawhandle's autodither
                state - see ObtainDrawHandleA().
                default: the drawhandle's autodither state.
        
        GGFX_RastLock (struct SignalSemaphore *) - pointer to an
                initialized exec.library SignalSemaphore which is
                used for RastPort sharing between tasks. if you want
                to draw to the drawhandle's RastPort while another
                task is rendering to this RastPort with DrawPictureA(),
                you must supply this argument and enclose all accesses
                to the RastPort with ObtainSemaphore()/ReleaseSemaphore()
                pairs. default: NULL (v16)
         
        RND_DestCoordinates (WORD *) - Pointer to an array of coordinates
                for texturemapped drawing. This array consists of 4 WORD pairs
                of x/y coordinates each. The array forms a trapezoid inside the
                destination rectangle. Any parameters are valid, since clipping
                is fully implemented. Texture-mapping and drawing are performed
                in a single pass, and there are no additional buffers allocated.
                Note that rotation can be easily implemented with this feature,
                since rotation is merely a special case of texture-mapping.
                See also the documentation of ObtainDrawHandleA()/GGFX_BGColor.                
                Default - NULL. (v16)

    RESULTS
        success     - TRUE if the picture could be drawn, FALSE
                      if there was not enough memory available.
                      Another reason for this function to fail is that
                      the optional callback hook returned FALSE.

    NOTES
        There is almost no overhead for scaling. Scaling is extremely
        fast and may be considered 'gratis'.

    EXAMPLE
        The callback hook allows to interrupt DrawPictureA() at any time. A
        simple callback function might look like this:

        ULONG __saveds __asm abortdrawfunc(register __a0 struct Hook *hook)
        {
            ULONG abortsignal = 1 << *((BYTE *) (hook->h_Data));
            if (SetSignal(0, 0) & abortsignal)
            {
                return FALSE;
            }
            else
            {
                return TRUE;
            }
        }
        
        In this example, an abortion signal was allocated and made available
        to the function via h_Data. If the signal arrives, the callback
        function returns FALSE to DrawPictureA(), and drawing will be
        interrupted.
        
        Note: Not all internal drawing-routines actually execute the hook
        function more than once. This mainly depends on the typical speed
        for a particular drawing routine or certain graphics.library or
        cybergraphics.library implementations. At least it is supported
        when scaling and rendering is involved to the drawing process.

                file supplied with the render.library distribution.
                You do not need this tag under normal circumstances.
                Default: not defined (will be set to the pen-sharemap's
                histogram type, or to the default type when needed)
        
    RESULTS
        picture  - pointer to a picture or NULL if something went wrong.
                   The exact reason for failure can be obtained via the
                   GGFX_ErrorCode tag.

    NOTES
        - As for current datatype implementations, alpha-channels
        do not seem to be supported. The datatype might translate
        it to a single bitplane.
        guigfx.library, on the other hand, does not (yet) support
        single-bitplane masks, so masks and transparency colors will
        be translated to alpha-channels.

    NAME
        LockPictureA - lock picture attributes. (v3)
        LockPicture  - varargs stub for LockPictureA.
        
        *** obsolete ***

    SYNOPSIS
        success = LockPictureA(picture,flags,arguments)
        d0                     a0      d0    a1

        BOOL LockPictureA(APTR,ULONG,ULONG *)
        
        BOOL LockPicture(APTR,ULONG,argument,...)

    FUNCTION
        This function locks certain picture attributes and
        prevents the picture from internal conversions that
        affect the specified flags.

    INPUTS
        picture     - pointer to a picture
        flags       - locking flags
        arguments   - flag-specific arguments

    FLAGS
        LOCKMODE_DRAWHANDLE drawhandle
        
                lock the picture to the specified drawhandle.
                this leads to optimized drawing without the
                need to render. combine with LOCKMODE_FORCE
                if you want to lock the image even if color
                information would be lost.

    RESULTS
        success  - TRUE if locking was successful, FALSE if
                   locking is not possible, or if locking
                   required a conversion with loss of
                   color information.

    NOTES
        This function is currently (v4) not working, and it
        will always return FALSE. If you need optimized drawing,
        use the method PICMTHD_MAPDRAWHANDLE instead.

    NAME
        MakePictureA - make a picture from raw data or from a BitMap.
        MakePicture  - varargs stub for MakePictureA.

    SYNOPSIS
        picture = MakePictureA(data,width,height,tags)
        d0                     a0   d0    d1     a1

        APTR MakePictureA(APTR,UWORD,UWORD,struct TagItem *)

        APTR MakePicture(APTR,UWORD,UWORD,tag,...,TAG_DONE)

    FUNCTION
        This function makes a picture from an array of raw
        data (or a part of it), or from a BitMap structure
        (or a part of it). Optionally, memory is allocated
        for a 'blank' picture. Optionally, the picture will
        be scaled.

        Raw data is not incorporated to the picture, instead
        it is referenced at its original location in memory,
        unless you specify the tag GGFX_Independent. (This does
        not apply to BitMap structures - pictures created from
        BitMaps are always independent.)

        If GGFX_Independent is not specified (and your picture
        is taken from its original location in memory), you may
        additionally specify a buffer 'overhang' with the tag
        GGFX_BufferSize. This allows internal conversions which
        require the image to grow at its original location in
        memory. You must be the owner of that memory, of course.

    INPUTS
        data    - pointer to
                  - an array of truecolor data,
                  - an array of chunky pixels,
                  - a BitMap structure
                  or NULL.
        width   - total width of the source array or BitMap [pixels]
        height  - total height of the source array or BitMap [rows]
        tags    - pointer to an array of TagItems

    TAGS
        GGFX_PixelFormat (ULONG) - pixel format. Currently defined are

                PIXFMT_CHUNKY_CLUT
                        chunky bytes, directly acting as indices
                        to a color-lookup-table.
                
                PIXFMT_0RGB_32
                        truecolor pixels (ULONG 0xaarrggbb).

                PIXFMT_BITMAP_CLUT
                        a BitMap structure with normal palette lookup.
                        You must also specify the GGFX_Palette and
                        GGFX_NumColors tags.

                PIXFMT_BITMAP_HAM8
                        a BitMap structure with HAM8 color lookup.
                        You must also specify the GGFX_Palette and
                        GGFX_NumColors tags.

                PIXFMT_BITMAP_HAM6
                        a BitMap structure with HAM6 color lookup.
                        You must also specify the GGFX_Palette and
                        GGFX_NumColors tags.

                PIXFMT_BITMAP_RGB
                        a BitMap structure which is assumed to contain
                        truecolor data. This may apply to CyberGraphX
                        bitmaps.

                Default: PIXFMT_CHUNKY_CLUT               


        GGFX_Palette (APTR) - pointer to a color table. If this
                tag is not specified with PIXFMT_CHUNKY_CLUT, a
                default palette of 256 grey tones will be generated.
                Default: NULL

        GGFX_NumColors (ULONG) - number of colors in the color table.
                This tag is mandatory when GGFX_Palette is specified
                (see above). Default: not defined
                
        GGFX_PaletteFormat (ULONG) - format of the palette. Currently
                defined are:
                      
                PALFMT_RGB8
                        ULONG 0x00rrggbb

                PALFMT_RGB32
                        ULONG red,green,blue. This is the LoadRGB32()
                        format without trailing longword.

                Default: PALFMT_RGB8

        GGFX_SourceX (ULONG) - left edge of an area inside the array
                or BitMap [pixels]. Default: 0.

        GGFX_SourceY (ULONG) - top edge of an area inside the array
                or BitMap [rows]. Default: 0.

        GGFX_SourceWidth (ULONG) - width of an area inside the array
                or BitMap [pixels]. Default: width.

                or BitMap [rows]. Default: height.

        GGFX_DestWidth (ULONG) - destination width of the resulting
                picture [pixels]. Default: GGFX_SourceWidth.
        
        GGFX_DestHeight (ULONG) - destination height for the resulting
                picture [rows]. Default: GGFX_SourceHeight.

        GGFX_BufferSize (ULONG) - total size of the specified buffer
                in bytes. This defines an 'oversized' buffer for the
                array of pixels. It informs the picture to what size
                it may grow for internal conversions.
                This tag is ignored when you supply a BitMap structure,
                or when GGFX_Independent is specified.
                Default: Required size in bytes
                for width * height * bytes_per_pixel.

        GGFX_AspectX (ULONG) - picture's horizontal aspect.
                Default: 1

        GGFX_AspectY (ULONG) - picture's vertical aspect.
                Default: 1

        GGFX_AlphaPresent (BOOL) - flag to indicate that the array
                contains alpha-channel information. This tag is only
                considered with PIXFMT_0RGB_32. Default: FALSE

        GGFX_Independent (BOOL) - If set to TRUE, the pixel array will
                always be copied to a seperate buffer that is maintained
                with the picture internally. This tag is meaningless when
                the input data is a BitMap structure. Default: FALSE

        GGFX_HSType (ULONG) - picture's internal histogram type, according
                to the histogram types defined in render/render.h.
                Better you never touch this tag, unless you know exactly
                what you are doing. Consider reading the 'memory' text
                file supplied with the render.library distribution.
                You do not need this tag under normal circumstances.
                Default: not defined (will be set to a pensharemap's
                histogram type, or to the default type when needed)

    RESULTS
        picture  - pointer to a picture or NULL if something went wrong.

    NAME
        ObtainDrawHandleA - obtain a handle for drawing.
        ObtainDrawHandle  - varargs stub for ObtainDrawHandleA.

    SYNOPSIS
        drawhandle = ObtainDrawHandleA(pensharemap,rastport,colormap,tags)
        d0                             a0          a1       a2       a3

        APTR ObtainDrawHandleA(APTR,struct RastPort *,struct ColorMap *,
                               struct TagItem *)

        APTR ObtainDrawHandle(APTR,struct RastPort *,struct ColorMap *,
                              tag,...,TAG_DONE)

    FUNCTION
        This function obtains a drawhandle for drawing to a RastPort.
        Depending on the RastPort's environment, pens may be allocated
        from the ColorMap.

        Before a pen-sharemap is passed to this function, it has to
        be loaded with colors via AddPictureA(), AddPaletteA(), and/or
        AddPixelArrayA(). Otherwise ObtainDrawHandleA() returns NULL.
        
        Optionally, you may specify NULL for the pen-sharemap argument,
        in which case a drawhandle for a static palette will be
        generated.

    INPUTS
        pensharemap - pointer to a pen-sharemap created with
                      CreatePenShareMapA(), or NULL.
        rastport    - pointer to a RastPort
        colormap    - pointer to a ColorMap. Usually, this is
                      screen->ViewPort.ColorMap of the rastport's screen.
        tags        - pointer to an array of TagItems

    TAGS
        OBP_Precision (ULONG) - precision for pen allocations,
                according to the definitions in graphics/view.h.
                See also graphics.library/ObtainBestPenA().
                Default: PRECISION_IMAGE.
                
                Note: The default precision suffices for almost every
                application. ObtainDrawHandleA() obtains pens in an
                extremely effective way. You get excellent results
                even with lower precisions. Commodore's idea with
                ObtainBestPenA() was to create a fair and effective
                pen-sharing mechanism, and ObtainDrawHandleA() behaves
                in perfect accordance to this intention. Never use
                insane patches for ObtainBestPenA().
                
        GGFX_DitherMode (ULONG) - dither mode. Currently available are:

                DITHERMODE_NONE
                        no dithering at all
                
                DITHERMODE_FS
                        Floyd-Steinberg dithering
                        
                DITHERMODE_RANDOM
                        Random dithering. This mode is significantly
                        slower than Floyd-Steinberg dithering.

                DITHERMODE_EDD
                        EDD dithering. This mode is faster than
                        Floyd-Steinberg dithering.
                
                Default: DITHERMODE_FS.

        GGFX_DitherAmount (ULONG) - dither amount. Valid range: 0...255.
                Currently this value is of any use only for
                DITHERMODE_RANDOM. Default: 40

        GGFX_AutoDither (BOOL) - automatic dither activation.
                If set to TRUE, dithering is automatically activated for
                drawing a particular picture to a particular environment,
                when the loss of color information would exceed a certain
                threshold (see below). Default: TRUE

        GGFX_DitherThreshold (ULONG) - threshold for automatic dithering.
                The lower, the earlier automatic dithering is activated.
                Useful thresholds range between 10 and 10000. Refer to
                render.library/RGBArrayDiversityA() for further details.
                better you do not use this tag unless you have a good
                reason to. let the user customize it with the environment
                variable AUTODITHERTHRESHOLD. Default: 250

        GGFX_MaxAllocPens (ULONG) - limit for the number of pens to be
                allocated from the ColorMap. Do not use this feature
                unless you have a good reason to. Valid range: 0...256.
                Default: not defined

        GGFX_ModeID (ULONG) - screen's modeID. Currently, this is required
                for guigfx.library to detect HAM modes. The full HAM
                color range can be achieved only with this tag specified.
                Default: INVALID_ID (no HAM detection takes place)
        
        GGFX_BGColor (ULONG) - RGB of an optional background color. it
                will be considered when a picture is being drawn with
                texture-mapping/rotating enabled, and there are areas
                inside the destination rectangle on the rastport which are
                not covered by the resulting picture. these areas will be
                rendered with this color. see also
                DrawPictureA()/RND_DestCoordinates for further details.
                default: 0xffffffff, indicating that there is no background
                color. (v16)
                
    RESULTS
        drawhandle - pointer to a handle for drawing to rastports.

                         AddPictureA(), AddPaletteA(),
                         or AddPixelArrayA()

    NOTE
        DeletePenShareMap() arbitrarily frees all its
        colorhandles. There is no need to manually remove
        them. This function is only required if you wish to
        modify a pen-sharemap and then call ObtainDrawHandleA()
        again.
        
        Calling RemColorHandle() for colorhandles that have
        been removed with DeletePenShareMap() will be fatal.
