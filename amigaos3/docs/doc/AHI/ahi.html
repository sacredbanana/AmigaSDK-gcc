<FONT SIZE=+1>PURPOSE</FONT>
<PRE>
       The 'ahi.device' was first created because the lack of standards
       when it comes to sound cards on the Amiga. Another reason was to
       make it easier to write multi-channel music programs.

       This device is by no means the final and perfect solution. But
       hopefully, it can evolve into something useful until AT brings you
       The Real Thing (TM).

</PRE>
<FONT SIZE=+1>OVERVIEW</FONT>
<PRE>
       Please see the document "AHI Developer's Guide" for more
       information.


       * Driver based

       Each supported sound card is controlled by a library-based audio
       driver. For a 'dumb' sound card, a new driver could be written in
       a few hours. For a 'smart' sound card, it is possible to utilize an
       on-board DSP, for example, to maximize performance and sound quality.
       For sound cards with own DSP but little or no memory, it is possible
       to use the main CPU to mix channels and do the post-processing
       with the DSP. Drivers are available for most popular sound cards,
       as well as an 8SVX (mono) and AIFF/AIFC (mono &amp; stereo) sample render
       driver.
  
       * Fast, powerful mixing routines (yeah, right... haha)
  
       The device's mixing routines mix 8- or 16-bit signed samples, both
       mono and stereo, located in Fast-RAM and outputs 16-bit mono or stereo
       (with stereo panning if desired) data, using any number of channels
       (as long as 'any' means less than 128).  Tables can be used speed
       the mixing up (especially when using 8-bit samples).  The samples can
       have any length (including odd) and can have any number of loops.
       There are also so-called HiFi mixing routines that can be used, that
       use linear interpolation and gives 32 bit output.
       
       * Support for non-realtime mixing
  
       By providing a timing feature, it is possible to create high-
       quality output even if the processing power is lacking, by saving
       the output to disk, for example as an IFF AIFF or 8SXV file.
  
       * Audio database
  
       Uses ID codes, much like Screenmode IDs, to select the many
       parameters that can be set. The functions to access the audio
       database are not too different from those in 'graphics.library'.
       The device also features a requester to get an ID code from the
       user.
  
       * Both high- and low-level protocol
  
       By acting both like a device and a library, AHI gives the programmer
       a choice between full control and simplicity. The device API allows
       several programs to use the audio hardware at the same time, and
       the AUDIO: dos-device driver makes playing and recording sound very
       simple for both the programmer and user.
  
       * Future Compatible
  
       When AmigaOS gets device-independent audio worth it's name, it should
       not be too difficult to write a driver for AHI, allowing applications
       using 'ahi.device' to automatically use the new OS interface. At
       least I hope it wont.

<FONT SIZE=+1>SYNOPSIS</FONT>
<PRE>       audioctrl = <B>AHI_AllocAudioA</B>( tags );
       D0                           A1

       struct AHIAudioCtrl *AHI_AllocAudio( Tag, ... );

</PRE>
<FONT SIZE=+1>FUNCTION</FONT>
<PRE>       Allocates and initializes the audio hardware, selects the best
       mixing routine (if necessary) according to the supplied tags.
       To start playing you first need to call <A HREF="#AHI_ControlAudioA">AHI_ControlAudioA</A>().

</PRE>
<FONT SIZE=+1>INPUTS</FONT>
<PRE>       tags - A pointer to a tag list.

</PRE>
<FONT SIZE=+1>TAGS</FONT>
<PRE>
       AHIA_AudioID (ULONG) - The audio mode to use. Default is
           AHI_DEFAULT_ID. (AHI_DEFAULT_ID is the ID the user has selected
           in the preferences program. It's a good value to use the first
           time she starts your application.)

       AHIA_MixFreq (ULONG) - Desired mixing frequency. The actual
           mixing rate may or may not be exactly what you asked for.
           Default is AHI_DEFAULT_FREQ. (AHI_DEFAULT_FREQ is the user's
           prefered frequency.)

       AHIA_Channels (UWORD) - Number of channel to use. The actual
           number of channels used will be equal or grater than the
           requested. If too many channels were requested, this function
           will fail. This tag must be supplied.

       AHIA_Sounds (UWORD) - Number of sounds to use. This tag must be
           supplied.

       AHIA_SoundFunc (struct Hook *) - A function to call each time
           when a sound has been started. The function receives the
           following parameters:
               A0 - (struct Hook *)
               A2 - (struct AHIAudioCtrl *)
               A1 - (struct AHISoundMessage *)
           The hook may be called from an interrupt, so normal interrupt
           restrictions apply.

           The called function should follow normal register conventions,
           which means that d2-d7 and a2-a6 must be preserved.

           Default is NULL.

       AHIA_PlayerFunc (struct Hook *) - A function to be called at regular
           intervals. By using this hook there is no need for music players
           to use other timing, such as VBLANK or CIA timers. But the real
           reason it's present is that it makes it possible to do non-
           realtime mixing to disk.

           Using this interrupt source is currently the only supported way
           to ensure that no mixing occurs between calls to <A HREF="#AHI_SetVol">AHI_SetVol</A>(),
           <A HREF="#AHI_SetFreq">AHI_SetFreq</A>() or <A HREF="#AHI_SetSound">AHI_SetSound</A>().

           If the sound playback is done without mixing, 'realtime.library'
           is used to provide timing. The function receives the following
           parameters:
               A0 - (struct Hook *)
               A2 - (struct AHIAudioCtrl *)
               A1 - Undefined.
           Do not assume A1 contains any particular value!
           The hook may be called from an interrupt, so normal interrupt
           restrictions apply.

           The called function should follow normal register conventions,
           which means that d2-d7 and a2-a6 must be preserved.

           Default is NULL.

       AHIA_PlayerFreq (Fixed) - If non-zero, enables timing and specifies
           how many times per second PlayerFunc will be called. This must
           be specified if AHIA_PlayerFunc is! Do not use any extreme
           frequencies. The result of MixFreq/PlayerFreq must fit an UWORD,
           ie it must be less or equal to 65535. It is also suggested that
           you keep the result over 80. For normal use this should not be a
           problem. Note that the data type is Fixed, not integer. 50 Hz is
           50&lt;&lt;16.

           Default is a reasonable value. Don't depend on it.

       AHIA_MinPlayerFreq (Fixed) - The minimum frequency (AHIA_PlayerFreq)
           you will use. You MUST supply this if you are using the device's
           interrupt feature!

       AHIA_MaxPlayerFreq (Fixed) - The maximum frequency (AHIA_PlayerFreq)
           you will use. You MUST supply this if you are using the device's
           interrupt feature!

       AHIA_RecordFunc (struct Hook *) - This function will be called
           regularly when sampling is turned on (see <A HREF="#AHI_ControlAudioA">AHI_ControlAudioA</A>())
           with the following parameters:
               A0 - (struct Hook *)
               A2 - (struct AHIAudioCtrl *)
               A1 - (struct AHIRecordMessage *)
           The message (AHIRecordMessage) is filled as follows:
               ahirm_Buffer - Pointer to the samples. The buffer is valid
                   until next time the Hook is called.
               ahirm_Length - Number of sample FRAMES in buffer.
                   To get the size in bytes, multiply by 4 if ahiim_Type is
                   AHIST_S16S.
               ahirm_Type - Always AHIST_S16S at the moment, but you *must*
                   check this, since it may change in the future!
           The hook may be called from an interrupt, so normal interrupt
           restrictions apply. Signal a process if you wish to save the
           buffer to disk. The called function should follow normal register
           conventions, which means that d2-d7 and a2-a6 must be preserved.

           NOTE: The function MUST return NULL (in d0). This was previously
           not documented. Now you know.

           Default is NULL.

       AHIA_UserData (APTR) - Can be used to initialize the ahiac_UserData
           field. Default is 0.

       user input.

       Note that tag values stay in effect for each use of the requester
       until they are cleared or modified by passing the same tag with a
       new value.

</PRE>
<FONT SIZE=+1>INPUTS</FONT>
<PRE>       requester - Requester structure allocated with
           <A HREF="#AHI_AllocAudioRequestA">AHI_AllocAudioRequestA</A>(). If this parameter is NULL, this
           function will always return FALSE with a dos.library/IoErr()
           result of ERROR_NO_FREE_STORE.
       tags - Pointer to an optional tag list which may be used to control
           features of the requester.

</PRE>
<FONT SIZE=+1>TAGS</FONT>
<PRE>       Tags used for the requester (they look remarkable similar to the
       screen mode requester in ASL, don't they? ;-) )

       AHIR_Window (struct Window *) - Parent window of requester. If no
           AHIR_Screen tag is specified, the window structure is used to
           determine on which screen to open the requesting window.

       AHIR_PubScreenName (STRPTR) - Name of a public screen to open on.
           This overrides the screen used by AHIR_Window.

       AHIR_Screen (struct Screen *) - Screen on which to open the
           requester. This overrides the screen used by AHIR_Window or by
           AHIR_PubScreenName.

       AHIR_PrivateIDCMP (BOOL) - When set to TRUE, this tells AHI to
           allocate a new IDCMP port for the requesting window. If not
           specified or set to FALSE, and if AHIR_Window is provided, the
           requesting window will share AHIR_Window's IDCMP port.

       AHIR_IntuiMsgFunc (struct Hook *) - A function to call whenever an
           unknown Intuition message arrives at the message port being used
           by the requesting window. The function receives the following
           parameters:
               A0 - (struct Hook *)
               A1 - (struct IntuiMessage *)
               A2 - (struct AHIAudioModeRequester *)

       AHIR_SleepWindow (BOOL) - When set to TRUE, this tag will cause the
           window specified by AHIR_Window to be "put to sleep". That is, a
           busy pointer will be displayed in the parent window, and no
           gadget or menu activity will be allowed. This is done by opening
           an invisible Intuition Requester in the parent window.

       AHIR_UserData (APTR) - A 32-bit value that is simply copied in the
           ahiam_UserData field of the requester structure.

       AHIR_TextAttr (struct TextAttr *) - Font to be used for the
           requesting window's gadgets and menus. If this tag is not
           provided or its value is NULL, the default font of the screen
           on which the requesting window opens will be used. This font
           must already be in memory as AHI calls OpenFont() and not
           OpenDiskFont().

       AHIR_Locale (struct Locale *) - Locale to use for the requesting
           window. This determines the language used for the requester's
           gadgets and menus. If this tag is not provided or its value is
           NULL, the system's current default locale will be used.

       AHIR_TitleText (STRPTR) - Title to use for the requesting window.
           Default is no title.

       AHIR_PositiveText (STRPTR) - Label of the positive gadget in the
           requester. English default is "OK".

       AHIR_NegativeText (STRPTR) - Label of the negative gadget in the
           requester. English default is "Cancel".

       AHIR_InitialLeftEdge (WORD) - Suggested left edge of requesting
           window.

       AHIR_InitialTopEdge (WORD) - Suggested top edge of requesting
           window.

       AHIR_InitialWidth (WORD) - Suggested width of requesting window.

       AHIR_InitialHeight (WORD) - Suggested height of requesting window.

       AHIR_InitialAudioID (ULONG) - Initial setting of the Mode list view
           gadget (ahiam_AudioID). Default is ~0 (AHI_INVALID_ID), which
           means that no mode will be selected.

       AHIR_InitialMixFreq (ULONG) - Initial setting of the frequency
           slider. Default is the lowest frequency supported.

       AHIR_InitialInfoOpened (BOOL) - Whether to open the property
           information window automatically. Default is FALSE.

       AHIR_InitialInfoLeftEdge (WORD) - Initial left edge of information
           window.

       AHIR_InitialInfoTopEdge (WORD) - Initial top edge of information
           window.

       AHIR_DoMixFreq (BOOL) - Set this tag to TRUE to cause the requester
           to display the frequency slider gadget. Default is FALSE.

       AHIR_DoDefaultMode (BOOL) - Set this tag to TRUE to let the user
           select the mode she has set in the preferences program. If she
           selects this mode,  ahiam_AudioID will be AHI_DEFAULT_ID and
           ahiam_MixFreq will be AHI_DEFAULT_FREQ. Note that if you filter
           the mode list (see below), you must also check the mode (with
           <A HREF="#AHI_BestAudioIDA">AHI_BestAudioIDA</A>()) before you use it since the user may change 
           the meaning of AHI_DEFAULT_MODE anytime, without your knowledge.
           Default is FALSE. (V4)

       AHIR_FilterFunc (struct Hook *) - A function to call for each mode
           encountered. If the function returns TRUE, the mode is included
           in the file list, otherwise it is rejected and not displayed. The
           function receives the following parameters:
               A0 - (struct Hook *)
               A1 - (ULONG) mode id
               A2 - (struct AHIAudioModeRequester *)

       AHIR_FilterTags (struct TagItem *) - A pointer to a tag list used to
           filter modes away, like AHIR_FilterFunc does. The tags are the
           same as <A HREF="#AHI_BestAudioIDA">AHI_BestAudioIDA</A>() takes as arguments. See that function
           for an explanation of each tag.

</PRE>
<FONT SIZE=+1>RESULT</FONT>
<PRE>       result - FALSE if the user cancelled the requester or if something
           prevented the requester from opening. If TRUE, values in the
           requester structure will be set.

           If the return value is FALSE, you can look at the result from the
           dos.library/IoErr() function to determine whether the requester

<PRE>       Many combinations are probably stupid to ask for, like not supporting
       panning or recording.

       AHIDB_AudioID (ULONG) - The mode must use the same audio hardware
           as this mode does.

       AHIDB_Volume (BOOL) - If TRUE: mode must support volume changes.
           If FALSE: mode must not support volume changes.

       AHIDB_Stereo (BOOL) - If TRUE: mode must have stereo output.
           If FALSE: mode must not have stereo output (=mono).

       AHIDB_Panning (BOOL) - If TRUE: mode must support volume panning.
           If FALSE: mode must not support volume panning. 

       AHIDB_HiFi (BOOL) - If TRUE: mode must have HiFi output.
           If FALSE: mode must not have HiFi output.

       AHIDB_PingPong (BOOL) - If TRUE: mode must support playing samples
           backwards. If FALSE: mode must not support playing samples
           backwards.

       AHIDB_Record (BOOL) - If TRUE: mode must support recording. If FALSE:
           mode must not support recording.

       AHIDB_Realtime (BOOL) - If TRUE: mode must be realtime. If FALSE:
           take a wild guess.

       AHIDB_FullDuplex (BOOL) - If TRUE: mode must be able to record and
           play at the same time.

       AHIDB_Bits (UBYTE) - Mode must have greater or equal number of bits.

       AHIDB_MaxChannels (UWORD) - Mode must have greater or equal number
           of channels.

       AHIDB_MinMixFreq (ULONG) - Lowest mixing frequency supported must be
           less or equal.

       AHIDB_MaxMixFreq (ULONG) - Highest mixing frequency must be greater
           or equal.

       AHIB_Dizzy (struct TagItem *) - This tag points to a second tag list.
           After all other tags has been tested, the mode that matches these
           tags best is returned, i.e. the one that has most of the features
           you ask for, and least of the ones you don't want. Without this
           second tag list, this function hardly does what its name

       tags - A pointer to a tag list.

</PRE>
<FONT SIZE=+1>TAGS</FONT>
<PRE>       AHIC_Play (BOOL) - Starts (TRUE) and stops (FALSE) playback and
           PlayerFunc. NOTE: If the audio hardware cannot play at the same
           time as recording samples, the recording will be stopped.

       AHIC_Record (BOOL) - Starts (TRUE) and stops (FALSE) sampling and

           much of the input signal is mixed with the output signal while
           recording. Use <A HREF="#AHI_GetAudioAttrsA">AHI_GetAudioAttrsA</A>() to find the available range.

       AHIC_MonitorVolume_Query (Fixed *) - Get the current input monitor
           volume. ti_Data is a pointer to a Fixed variable, where the result
           will be stored.

       AHIC_MixFreq_Query (ULONG *) - Get the current mixing frequency.
           ti_Data is a pointer to an ULONG variable, where the result will

       AHIA_PlayerFreq (Fixed)
       AHIA_RecordFunc (struct Hook *)
       AHIA_UserData (APTR)

       Note that AHIA_PlayerFreq must never be outside the limits specified

<FONT SIZE=+1>TAGS</FONT>
<PRE>       AHIDB_Volume (ULONG *) - TRUE if this mode supports volume changes.

       AHIDB_Stereo (ULONG *) - TRUE if output is in stereo. Unless
           AHIDB_Panning (see below) is TRUE, all even channels are played
           to the left and all odd to the right.

       AHIDB_Panning (ULONG *) - TRUE if this mode supports stereo panning.

       AHIDB_HiFi (ULONG *) - TRUE if no shortcuts, like pre-division, is

       AHIDB_Record (ULONG *) - TRUE if this mode can record samples.

       AHIDB_FullDuplex (ULONG *) - TRUE if this mode can record and play at
           the same time.

       AHIDB_Realtime (ULONG *) - Modes which return TRUE for this fulfills
           two criteria:
           1) Calls to <A HREF="#AHI_SetVol">AHI_SetVol</A>(), <A HREF="#AHI_SetFreq">AHI_SetFreq</A>() or <A HREF="#AHI_SetSound">AHI_SetSound</A>() will be
              performed within (about) 10 ms if called from a PlayFunc Hook.
           2) The PlayFunc Hook will be called at the specified frequency.
           If you don't use AHI's PlayFunc Hook, you must not use modes that
           are not realtime. (Criterium 2 is not that obvious if you consider
           a mode that renders the output to disk as a sample.)

       AHIDB_Bits (ULONG *) - The number of output bits (8, 12, 14, 16 etc).

       AHIDB_Frequency (ULONG *) - Return the frequency associated with the
           index number specified with AHIDB_FrequencyArg (see above).

       AHIDB_IndexArg (ULONG) - AHIDB_Index will return the index which
           gives the closest frequency to AHIDB_IndexArg
           NOTE: ti_Data is NOT a pointer, but an ULONG.

       AHIDB_Index (ULONG *) - Return the index associated with the frequency
           specified with AHIDB_IndexArg (see above).

       AHIDB_MaxPlaySamples (ULONG *) - Return the lowest number of sample
           frames that must be present in memory when AHIST_DYNAMICSAMPLE
           sounds are used. This number must then be scaled by Fs/Fm, where
           Fs is the frequency of the sound and Fm is the mixing frequency.

       AHIDB_MaxRecordSamples (ULONG *) - Return the number of sample frames
           you will receive each time the RecordFunc is called.

       AHIDB_BufferLen (ULONG) - Specifies how many characters will be
           copied when requesting text attributes. Default is 0, which
           means that AHIDB_Driver, AHIDB_Name, AHIDB_Author,
           AHIDB_Copyright, AHIDB_Version and AHIDB_Annotation,
           AHIDB_Input and AHIDB_Output will do nothing.

       AHIDB_MaxMonitorVolume (Fixed *) - Lower/upper limit for input
           monitor volume, see <A HREF="#AHI_ControlAudioA">AHI_ControlAudioA</A>(). If both are 0.0,
           the sound hardware does not have an input monitor feature.

<FONT SIZE=+1>FUNCTION</FONT>
<PRE>       Defines an ID number for the sound and prepares it for playback.

</PRE>
<FONT SIZE=+1>INPUTS</FONT>
<PRE>       sound - The numeric ID to be used as a reference to this sound.
           The ID is a number greater or equal to 0 and less than what you
           specified with AHIA_Sounds when you called <A HREF="#AHI_AllocAudioA">AHI_AllocAudioA</A>().
       type - The type of the sound. Currently four types are supported:
           AHIST_SAMPLE - array of 8 or 16 bit samples. Note that the
               portion of memory where the sample is stored must NOT be
               altered until <A HREF="#AHI_UnloadSound">AHI_UnloadSound</A>() has been called! This is
               because some audio drivers may wish to upload the samples
               to local RAM. It is OK to read, though.

           AHIST_DYNAMICSAMPLE - array of 8 or 16 bit samples, which can be
               updated dynamically. Typically used to play data that is
               loaded from disk or calculated realtime.
               Avoid using this sound type as much as possible; it will
               use much more CPU power than AHIST_SAMPLE on a DMA/DSP
               sound card.

           AHIST_INPUT - The input from your sampler (not fully functional
               yet).

       info - Depends on type:
           AHIST_SAMPLE - A pointer to a struct AHISampleInfo, filled with:
               ahisi_Type - Format of samples (four formats are supported).
                   AHIST_M8S: Mono, 8 bit signed (BYTEs).
                   AHIST_S8S: Stereo, 8 bit signed (2×BYTEs) (V4). 
                   AHIST_M16S: Mono, 16 bit signed (WORDs).
                   AHIST_S16S: Stereo, 16 bit signed (2×WORDs) (V4).
               ahisi_Address - Address to the sample array.
               ahisi_Length - The size of the array, in samples.
               Don't even think of setting ahisi_Address to 0 and
               ahisi_Length to 0xffffffff as you can do with
               AHIST_DYNAMICSAMPLE! Very few DMA/DSP cards have 4 GB onboard
               RAM...

           AHIST_DYNAMICSAMPLE A pointer to a struct AHISampleInfo, filled
               as described above (AHIST_SAMPLE).
               If ahisi_Address is 0 and ahisi_Length is 0xffffffff
               <A HREF="#AHI_SetSound">AHI_SetSound</A>() can take the real address of an 8 bit sample
               to be played as offset argument. Unfortunately, this does not
               work for 16 bit samples.

           AHIST_INPUT - Always set info to NULL.
               Note that <A HREF="#AHI_SetFreq">AHI_SetFreq</A>() may only be called with AHI_MIXFREQ
               for this sample type.

       audioctrl - A pointer to an AHIAudioCtrl structure.

</PRE>
<FONT SIZE=+1>FUNCTION</FONT>
<PRE>       This function performs the same actions as multiple calls to
       <A HREF="#AHI_SetFreq">AHI_SetFreq</A>(), <A HREF="#AHI_SetSound">AHI_SetSound</A>() and <A HREF="#AHI_SetVol">AHI_SetVol</A>(). The advantages
       of using only one call is that simple loops can be set without
       using a SoundFunc (see <A HREF="#AHI_AllocAudioA">AHI_AllocAudioA</A>(), tag AHIA_SoundFunc) and
       that sounds on different channels can be synchronized even when the
       sounds are not started from a PlayerFunc (see <A HREF="#AHI_AllocAudioA">AHI_AllocAudioA</A>(), tag
       AHIA_PlayerFunc). The disadvantage is that this call has more
       overhead than <A HREF="#AHI_SetFreq">AHI_SetFreq</A>(), <A HREF="#AHI_SetSound">AHI_SetSound</A>() and <A HREF="#AHI_SetVol">AHI_SetVol</A>(). It is
       therefore recommended that you only use this call if you are not
       calling from a SoundFunc or PlayerFunc.

       the order of tags matter.

</PRE>

</PRE>
<FONT SIZE=+1>TAGS</FONT>
<PRE>       AHIP_BeginChannel (UWORD) - Before you start setting attributes
           for a sound to play, you have to use this tag to chose a
           channel to operate on. If AHIP_BeginChannel is omitted, the
           result is undefined.

       AHIP_EndChannel (ULONG) - Signals the end of attributes for
           the current channel. If AHIP_EndChannel is omitted, the result
           is undefined. ti_Data MUST BE NULL!

       AHIP_Freq (ULONG) - The playback frequency in Hertz or AHI_MIXFREQ.

       AHIP_Vol (Fixed) - The desired volume. If omitted, but AHIP_Pan is
           present, AHIP_Vol defaults to 0.

       AHIP_Pan (sposition) - The desired panning. If omitted, but AHIP_Vol
           is present, AHIP_Pan defaults to 0 (extreme left).

       AHIP_Sound (UWORD) - Sound to be played, or AHI_NOSOUND.

       AHIP_Offset (ULONG) - Specifies an offset (in samples) into the
           sound. If this tag is present, AHIP_Length MUST be present too!

       AHIP_Length (LONG) - Specifies how many samples that should be
           player.

       AHIP_LoopFreq (ULONG)
       AHIP_LoopVol (Fixed)
       AHIP_LoopPan (sposition)
       AHIP_LoopSound (UWORD)
       AHIP_LoopOffset (ULONG)
       AHIP_LoopLength (LONG) - These tags can be used to set simple loop
          attributes. They default to their sisters. These tags must be
          after the other tags.

</PRE>
<FONT SIZE=+1>FUNCTION</FONT>
<PRE>       Selects an effect to be used, described by a structure.

</PRE>
<FONT SIZE=+1>INPUTS</FONT>
<PRE>       effect - A pointer to an effect data structure, as defined in
           &lt;devices/ahi.h&gt;. The following effects are defined:
           AHIET_MASTERVOLUME - Changes the volume for all channels. Can
               also be used to boost volume over 100%.
           AHIET_OUTPUTBUFFER - Gives READ-ONLY access to the mixed output.
               Can be used to show nice scopes and VU-meters.
           AHIET_DSPMASK - Select which channels will be affected by the
               DSP effects. (V4)
           AHIET_DSPECHO - A DSP effects that adds (cross-)echo and delay.
               (V4)
           AHIET_CHANNELINFO - Get info about all channels. (V4)
       audioctrl - A pointer to an AHIAudioCtrl structure.

</PRE>
<FONT SIZE=+1>EFFECTS</FONT>
<PRE>       AHIET_MASTERVOLUME - Effect is a struct AHIEffMasterVolume, with
           ahiemv_Volume set to the desired volume. The range is 0 to
           (channels/hardware channel). Assume you have 4 channels in
           mono mode. The range is then 0.0 to 4.0. The range is the same
           if the mode is stereo with panning. However, assume you have 4
           channels with a stereo mode *without* panning. Then you have two
           channels to the left and two to the right =&gt; range is 0.0 - 2.0.
           Setting the volume outside the range will give an unpredictable
           result!

       AHIET_OUTPUTBUFFER - Effect is a struct AHIEffOutputBuffer, with
           ahieob_Func pointing to a hook that will be called with the
           following parameters:
               A0 - (struct Hook *)
               A2 - (struct AHIAudioCtrl *)
               A1 - (struct AHIEffOutputBuffer *)
           The information you are looking for then is in ahieob_Type,
           ahieob_Buffer and ahieob_Length. Always check ahieob_Type!
           ahieob_Length is neither in bytes nor samples, but sample frames.

       AHIET_DSPMASK - Effect is a struct AHIEffDSPMask, where ahiedm_Mask
           is an array with ahiedm_Channels elements. Each UBYTE in the
           array can either make the channel 'wet' (affected by the DSP
           effects), by using the AHIEDM_WET constant or 'dry' (not
           affected by the DSP effects) by using the AHIEDM_DRY constant.
           The default is all channels wet. If ahiedm_Channels does not
           equal the current number of channels allocated, the result of
           this call is undefined (crash warning!). (V4)

       AHIET_DSPECHO - Effect is a struct AHIEffDSPEcho.
           ahiede_Delay is the delay in samples (and thus depends on the
           mixing rate).

           ahiede_Feedback is a Fixed value between 0 and 1.0, and defines
           how much of the delayed signal should be feed back to the delay
           stage. Setting this to 0 gives a delay effect, otherwise echo.

           ahiede_Mix tells how much of the delayed signal should be mixed
           with the normal signal. Setting this to 0 disables delay/echo,
           and setting it to 1.0 outputs only the delay/echo signal.

           ahiede_Cross only has effect of the current playback mode is
           stereo. It tells how the delayed signal should be panned to
           the other channel. 0 means no cross echo, 1.0 means full
           cross echo.

           If the user has enabled "Fast Echo", AHI may take several short-
           cuts to increase the performance. This could include rounding the
           parameters to a power of two, or even to the extremes. 

           If you set ahiede_Mix to 0x10000 and ahiede_Cross to 0x0, much
           faster mixing routines will be used, and "Fast Echo" will improve
           that even more.

           Otherwise, even with "Fast Echo" turned on, this effect will 
           probably suck some major CPU cycles on most sound hardware. (V4)

       AHIET_CHANNELINFO - Effect is a struct AHIEffChannelInfo, where
           ahieci_Func is pointing to a hook that will be called with the
           following parameters:
               A0 - (struct Hook *)
               A2 - (struct AHIAudioCtrl *)
               A1 - (struct AHIEffChannelInfo *)
           ahieci_Channels must equal the current number of channels used.
           ahieci_Offset is an array of ULONGs, which will be filled by
           AHI before the hook is called (the offset is specified in sample
           frames). The array must have at least ahieci_Channels elements.

           This "effect" can be used to find out how far each channel has
           played. You must probably keep track of the other parameters
           yourself (like which sound is playing, it's volume, balance and
           frequency etc) in order have meaningful usage of the information.
           (V4)


       NOTE! To turn off an effect, call again with ahie_Effect OR:ed
       with AHIET_CANCEL. For example, it is NOT correct to disable
       the AHIET_MASTERVOLUME effect by setting ahiemv_Volume to 1.0!

       It is important that you always turn off effects before you
       deallocate the audio hardware. Otherwise memory may be lost.
       It is safe to turn off an effect that has never been turned on
       in the first place.

       Never count on that an effect will be available. For example,
       AHIET_OUTPUTBUFFER is impossible to implement with some sound
       cards.

<PRE>       channel - The channel to set sound for.
       sound - Sound to be played, or AHI_NOSOUND to turn the channel off.
       offset - Only available if the sound type is AHIST_SAMPLE or
           AHIST_DYNAMICSAMPLE. Must be 0 otherwise.
           Specifies an offset (in samples) where the playback will begin.
           If you wish to play the whole sound, set offset to 0.
       length - Only available if the sound type is AHIST_SAMPLE or
           AHIST_DYNAMICSAMPLE. Must be 0 otherwise.
           Specifies how many samples that should be played. If you
           wish to play the whole sound forwards, set offset to 0 and length
           to either 0 or the length of the sample array. You may not set
           length to 0 if offset is not 0! To play a sound backwards, just
           set length to a negative number.
       audioctrl - A pointer to an AHIAudioCtrl structure.
       flags - Only one flag is defined
           AHISF_IMM - Set this flag if this command should take effect
               immediately. If this bit is not set, the command will not

</PRE>
<FONT SIZE=+1>FUNCTION</FONT>
<PRE>       Changes the volume and stereo panning for a channel.

</PRE>
<FONT SIZE=+1>INPUTS</FONT>
<PRE>       channel - The channel to set volume for.
       volume - The desired volume. Fixed is a LONG fixed-point value with
           16 bits to the left of the point and 16 to the right
           (typedef LONG Fixed; from IFF-8SVX docs).
           Maximum volume is 1.0 (0x10000L) and 0.0 (0x0L) will turn off
           this channel. Note: The sound will continue to play, but you
           wont hear it. To stop a sound completely, use <A HREF="#AHI_SetSound">AHI_SetSound</A>().
           Starting with V4 volume can also be negative, which tells AHI
           to invert the samples before playing. Note that all drivers
           may not be able to handle negative volume. In that case the
           absolute volume will be used.
       pan - The desired panning. sposition is the same as Fixed
           (typedef Fixed sposition; from IFF-8SVX.PAN docs).
           1.0 (0x10000L) means that the sound is panned all the way to
           the right, 0.5 (0x8000L) means the sound is centered and 0.0
           (0x0L) means that the sound is panned all the way to the left.
           Try to set Pan to the 'correct' value even if you know it has no
           effect. For example, if you know you use a mono mode, set pan to
           0.5 even if it does not matter.
           Starting with V4 pan can also be negative, which tells AHI to
           use the surround speaker for this channel. Note that all drivers
           may not be able to handle negative pan. In that case the absolute
           pan will be used.
       audioctrl - A pointer to an AHIAudioCtrl structure.
       flags - Only one flag is defined
           AHISF_IMM - Set this flag if this command should take effect
               immediately. If this bit is not set, the command will not
               take effect until the current sound is finished. MUST NOT

                           SizeAvailable  - Must be cleared.
                       It is probably good manners to clear all other
                       fields as well.
       io_Length       Size of the NSDeviceQueryResult structure.

</PRE>
<FONT SIZE=+1>IO REQUEST RESULT</FONT>
<PRE>       io_Error        0 for success, or an error code as defined in
                       &lt;ahi/devices.h&gt; and &lt;exec/errors.h&gt;.
       io_Actual       If io_Error is 0, the value in
                       NSDeviceQueryResult.SizeAvailable.

       The NSDeviceQueryResult structure now contains valid information.

       The other fields, except io_Device, io_Unit and io_Command, are
       trashed.

<FONT SIZE=+1>SYNOPSIS</FONT>
<PRE>       error = <B>OpenDevice</B>(AHINAME, unit, ioRequest, flags)

       BYTE <B>OpenDevice</B>(STRPTR, ULONG, struct AHIRequest *, ULONG);

</PRE>
<FONT SIZE=+1>FUNCTION</FONT>
<PRE>       This is an exec call.  Exec will search for the ahi.device, and
       if found, will pass this call on to the device.

</PRE>
<FONT SIZE=+1>INPUTS</FONT>
<PRE>       AHINAME - pointer to the string "ahi.device".
       unit - Either AHI_DEFAULT_UNIT (0), AHI_NO_UNIT (255) or any other
           unit the user has requested, for example with a UNIT tooltype.
           AHI_NO_UNIT should be used when you're using the low-level
           API.
       ioRequest - a pointer to a struct AHIRequest, initialized by
           exec.library/CreateIORequest(). ahir_Version *must* be preset
           to the version you need!
       flags - There is only one flag defined, AHIDF_NOMODESCAN, which
           asks ahi.device not to build the audio mode database if not
           already initialized. It should not be used by applications
           without good reasons (AddAudioModes uses this flag).

</PRE>
<FONT SIZE=+1>RESULT</FONT>
<PRE>       error - Same as io_Error.
       io_Error - If the call succeeded, io_Error will be 0, else
           an error code as defined in &lt;exec/errors.h&gt; and
           &lt;devices/ahi.h&gt;.
       io_Device - A pointer to the device base, which can be used
           to call the functions the device provides.
