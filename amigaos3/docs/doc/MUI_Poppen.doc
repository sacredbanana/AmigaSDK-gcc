Poppen.mui/Poppen.mui
	Poppen class adds input capabilities to its super class Pendisplay. It
	should be used if your application allows users to configure some custom
	pens for rendering.

	A Poppen object will appear as kind of a button which displays the currently
	selected color. When the user hits the button, a Popup window containing a
	Penadjust object opens up and lets the user choose change the color.

	You can control the window title of the popup window using the
	MUIA_Window_Title on the Poppen object. It will remember its value and use
	it when creating the popup window.

	As most MUI popups, the Penadjust popup window runs asynchronously and stays
	there until the user terminates it with "OK" or "Cancel". Furthermore, if
	the popup window is automatically cancelled if the pop button receives a
	MUIM_Cleanup method.

	Anyway, you don't have to care about the internals of this class. Just
	create it like

	obj = MUI_NewObject(MUIC_Poppen,
	  MUIA_CycleChain , 1,
	  MUIA_Window_Title, "Color of Followed Links",
	  TAG_DONE);

	somewhere in your prefs window and everything will be fine. You can get/set
	the current color from a Poppen object by using the MUIA_Pendisplay_Spec
	attribute. The resulting struct MUI_SpenSpec may then be saved somewhere in
	your preferences and used as parameter for MUI_ObtainPen() and
	MUI_ReleasePen().

	You can find some example code on using this class in the Class2 demo of the
	MUI distribution.
