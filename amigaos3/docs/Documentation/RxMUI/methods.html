<p>Objects are black boxes, so you communicate with them via methods.</p>

<p>A method is an operation that an object can be requested to perform on itself.</p>

<p>A method is identified with a string.</p>

<p>Any class defines its own methods.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<p><strong>A method is applied</strong> on an object with: 

<ul>
  <li><a href="functions.html#DoMethod">DoMethod()</a> or <a
    href="functions.html#CoerceMethod">CoerceMethod()</a>, that apply the method <em>directly
    and immediately</em></li>
  <li><a href="functions.html#Notify">Notify()</a>, that applies the method on an object when
    an attribute of another object changes</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;<p><strong>A method is called:</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Direct - if it can be used in a DoMethod() call, e.g. Remove method of List class is
    direct</li>
  <li>Indirect - if it can be used in a Notify() call, e.g. Sort method of List class is
    indirect</li>
</ul>

<p>A method can be both direct and indirect, e.g. Sort method of List class is both direct
and indirect; or can be only direct, e.g. InputBuffered method of Application class is
direct but not indirect; or can be only indirect, e.g. Set method is indirect only.<br>
It means that</p>

<pre>    res=Notify(&quot;button&quot;,&quot;pressed&quot;,0,&quot;app&quot;,&quot;INPUTBUFFERED&quot;)</pre>

<p>is not legal (res is 72 [METHOD_NONOTIFY]).</p>

<p>and that</p>

<pre>    res = DoMethod(&quot;status&quot;,&quot;set&quot;,&quot;contents&quot;,&quot;hello world&quot;)</pre>

<p>is not legal (res is 71 [METHOD_NOTIFY_ONLY]).</p>
