  RxMUI documentation
  ===================

    RxMUI documentation is supplied as HTML files. Open your
    browser at main.html to read it.

    DocsBrowser.rexx is an ARexx macro that uses RxMUI.
    It might be used to browse RxMUI documentation, but only
    after RxMUI has been installed.

    It also needs HTMLview.mcc in MUI:LIBS/MUI to work.
