     A small number of signals which cause abnormal termination of a process
     also cause a record of the process's in-core state to be written to disk
     for later examination by one of the available debuggers.  (See
     sigaction(2).)  This memory image is written to a file named
     pprrooggrraammnnaammee..ccoorree in the working directory; provided the terminated pro-
     cess had write permission in the directory, and provided the abnormality
     did not cause a system crash.  (In this event, the decision to save the
     core file is arbitrary, see savecore(8).)

     The maximum size of a pprrooggrraammnnaammee..ccoorree file is limited by setrlimit(2).
     Files which would be larger than the limit are not created.

     The pprrooggrraammnnaammee..ccoorree file consists of the _u. area, whose size (in pages)
     is defined by the UPAGES manifest in the <_s_y_s_/_p_a_r_a_m_._h> file.  The _u. area
     starts with a _u_s_e_r structure as given in <_s_y_s_/_u_s_e_r_._h>. The remainder of
     the pprrooggrraammnnaammee..ccoorree file consists of the data pages followed by the
     stack pages of the process image.  The amount of data space image in the
     pprrooggrraammnnaammee..ccoorree file is given (in pages) by the variable _u___d_s_i_z_e in the
     _u. area.  The amount of stack image in the core file is given (in pages)
     by the variable _u___s_s_i_z_e in the _u. area.  The size of a ``page'' is given
     by the constant NBPG (also from <_s_y_s_/_p_a_r_a_m_._h>).
