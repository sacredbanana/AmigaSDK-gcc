     eetthheerrss - Ethernet host name data base

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The ethers file maps Ethernet addresses to host names.  Lines consist of
     an address and a host name, separated by any number of blanks and/or tab
     characters.  A ``#'' indicates the beginning of a comment; characters up
     to the end of the line are not interpreted by routines which search the
     file.

     Ethernet addresses are expressed as six hexadecimal numbers separated by
     colons.  The functions described in ethers(3) and ether_aton(3) can read
     and produce this format.
