     This section contains information related to system operation and mainte-
     nance.  It describes commands used to create new file systems, `newfs',
     verify the integrity of the file systems, `fsck',  control disk usage,
     `edquota',  maintain system backups, `dump',  and recover files when
     disks die an untimely death, `restore'.  The `format'  manual for the
     specific architecture the system is running on should be consulted when
     formatting disks and tapes.  Network related services like `inetd'  and
     `ftpd'  are also described.  The section `crash'  should be consulted to
     understand how to interpret system crash dumps.
