     The gglloobb() function is a pathname generator that implements the rules for
     file name pattern matching used by the shell.

     The include file _g_l_o_b_._h defines the structure type _g_l_o_b___t, which contains
     at least the following fields:

     typedef struct {
             int gl_pathc;           /* count of total paths so far */
             int gl_matchc;          /* count of paths matching pattern */
             int gl_offs;            /* reserved at beginning of gl_pathv */
             int gl_flags;           /* returned flags */
             char **gl_pathv;        /* list of paths matching pattern */
     } glob_t;

     The argument _p_a_t_t_e_r_n is a pointer to a pathname pattern to be expanded.
     The gglloobb() argument matches all accessible pathnames against the pattern
     and creates a list of the pathnames that match.  In order to have access
     to a pathname, gglloobb() requires search permission on every component of a
     path except the last and read permission on each directory of any file-
     name component of _p_a_t_t_e_r_n that contains any of the special characters
     `*', `?' or `['.

     The gglloobb() argument stores the number of matched pathnames into the
     _g_l___p_a_t_h_c field, and a pointer to a list of pointers to pathnames into the
     _g_l___p_a_t_h_v field.  The first pointer after the last pathname is NULL. If
     the pattern does not match any pathnames, the returned number of matched
     paths is set to zero.

     It is the caller's responsibility to create the structure pointed to by
     _p_g_l_o_b. The gglloobb() function allocates other space as needed, including the
     memory pointed to by _g_l___p_a_t_h_v.

     The argument _f_l_a_g_s is used to modify the behavior of gglloobb().  The value
     of _f_l_a_g_s is the bitwise inclusive OR of any of the following values de-
     fined in _g_l_o_b_._h:

     GLOB_APPEND      Append pathnames generated to the ones from a previous
                      call (or calls) to gglloobb().  The value of _g_l___p_a_t_h_c will
                      be the total matches found by this call and the previous
                      call(s).  The pathnames are appended to, not merged with
                      the pathnames returned by the previous call(s).  Between
                      calls, the caller must not change the setting of the
                      GLOB_DOOFFS flag, nor change the value of _g_l___o_f_f_s when
                      GLOB_DOOFFS is set, nor (obviously) call gglloobbffrreeee() for
                      _p_g_l_o_b.

     GLOB_DOOFFS      Make use of the _g_l___o_f_f_s field.  If this flag is set,
                      _g_l___o_f_f_s is used to specify how many NULL pointers to
                      prepend to the beginning of the _g_l___p_a_t_h_v field.  In oth-
                      er words, _g_l___p_a_t_h_v will point to _g_l___o_f_f_s NULL pointers,
                      followed by _g_l___p_a_t_h_c pathname pointers, followed by a
                      NULL pointer.

     GLOB_ERR         Causes gglloobb() to return when it encounters a directory
                      that it cannot open or read.  Ordinarily, gglloobb() contin-
                      ues to find matches.

     GLOB_MARK        Each pathname that is a directory that matches _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
                      has a slash appended.

     GLOB_NOCHECK     If _p_a_t_t_e_r_n does not match any pathname, then gglloobb() re-
                      turns a list consisting of only _p_a_t_t_e_r_n, with the number
                      of total pathnames is set to 1, and the number of
                      matched pathnames set to 0.  If GLOB_QUOTE is set, its
                      effect is present in the pattern returned.

     GLOB_NOSORT      By default, the pathnames are sorted in ascending ASCII
                      order; this flag prevents that sorting (speeding up
                      gglloobb()).

     The following values may also be included in _f_l_a_g_s, however, they are
     non-standard extensions to IEEE Std1003.2 (``POSIX'').

     GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC  The following additional fields in the pglob structure
                      have been initialized with alternate functions for glob
                      to use to open, read, and close directories and to get
                      stat information on names found in those directories.

                              void *(*gl_opendir)(const char * name);
                              struct dirent *(*gl_readdir)(void *);
                              void (*gl_closedir)(void *);
                              int (*gl_lstat)(const char *name, struct stat *st);
                              int (*gl_stat)(const char *name, struct stat *st);

                      This extension is provided to allow programs such as re-
                      store(8) to provide globbing from directories stored on
                      tape.

     GLOB_BRACE       Pre-process the pattern string to expand `{pat,pat,...}'
                      strings like csh(1.)The pattern  `{}' is left unexpanded
                      for historical reasons (Csh(1) does the same thing to
                      ease typing of find(1) patterns).

     GLOB_MAGCHAR     Set by the gglloobb() function if the pattern included glob-
                      bing characters.  See the description of the usage of
                      the _g_l___m_a_t_c_h_c structure member for more details.

     GLOB_NOMAGIC     Is the same as GLOB_NOCHECK but it only appends the
                      _p_a_t_t_e_r_n if it does not contain any of the special char-
                      acters ``*'', ``?'' or ``[''.  GLOB_NOMAGIC is provided
                      to simplify implementing the historic csh(1) globbing
                      behavior and should probably not be used anywhere else.

     GLOB_QUOTE       Use the backslash (`\') character for quoting: every oc-
                      currence of a backslash followed by a character in the
                      pattern is replaced by that character, avoiding any spe-
                      cial interpretation of the character.

     GLOB_TILDE       Expand patterns that start with `~' to user name home
                      directories.

     If, during the search, a directory is encountered that cannot be opened
     or read and _e_r_r_f_u_n_c is non-NULL, gglloobb() calls _(_*_e_r_r_f_u_n_c_)_(_p_a_t_h_, _e_r_r_n_o_).
     This may be unintuitive: a pattern like `*/Makefile' will try to stat(2)
     `foo/Makefile' even if `foo' is not a directory, resulting in a call to
     _e_r_r_f_u_n_c. The error routine can suppress this action by testing for ENOENT
     and ENOTDIR; however, the GLOB_ERR flag will still cause an immediate re-
     turn when this happens.

     If _e_r_r_f_u_n_c returns non-zero, gglloobb() stops the scan and returns GLOB_ABEND
     after setting _g_l___p_a_t_h_c and _g_l___p_a_t_h_v to reflect any paths already matched.
     This also happens if an error is encountered and GLOB_ERR is set in
     _f_l_a_g_s, regardless of the return value of _e_r_r_f_u_n_c, if called.  If GLOB_ERR
     is not set and either _e_r_r_f_u_n_c is NULL or _e_r_r_f_u_n_c returns zero, the error
     is ignored.

     The gglloobbffrreeee() function frees any space associated with _p_g_l_o_b from a pre-
     vious call(s) to gglloobb().

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEESS
     On successful completion, gglloobb() returns zero.  In addition the fields of
     _p_g_l_o_b contain the values described below:

     _g_l___p_a_t_h_c      contains the total number of matched pathnames so far.
                   This includes other matches from previous invocations of
                   gglloobb() if GLOB_APPEND was specified.

     _g_l___m_a_t_c_h_c     contains the number of matched pathnames in the current in-
                   vocation of gglloobb().

     _g_l___f_l_a_g_s      contains a copy of the _f_l_a_g_s parameter with the bit
                   GLOB_MAGCHAR set if _p_a_t_t_e_r_n contained any of the special
                   characters ``*'', ``?'' or ``['', cleared if not.

     _g_l___p_a_t_h_v      contains a pointer to a NULL-terminated list of matched
                   pathnames.  However, if _g_l___p_a_t_h_c is zero, the contents of
                   _g_l___p_a_t_h_v are undefined.

     If gglloobb() terminates due to an error, it sets _e_r_r_n_o and returns one of
     the following non-zero constants, which are defined in the include file
     <_g_l_o_b_._h>:

     GLOB_NOSPACE  An attempt to allocate memory failed.

     GLOB_ABEND    The scan was stopped because an error was encountered and
                   either GLOB_ERR was set or _(_*_e_r_r_f_u_n_c_)_(_) returned non-zero.

     The arguments _p_g_l_o_b_-_>_g_l___p_a_t_h_c and _p_g_l_o_b_-_>_g_l___p_a_t_h_v are still set as speci-
     fied above.

     The gglloobb() function is expected to be IEEE Std1003.2 (``POSIX'') compati-

     GLOB_MAGCHAR, GLOB_NOMAGIC, GLOB_QUOTE, and GLOB_TILDE, and the fields
     _g_l___m_a_t_c_h_c and _g_l___f_l_a_g_s should not be used by applications striving for
     strict POSIX conformance.
