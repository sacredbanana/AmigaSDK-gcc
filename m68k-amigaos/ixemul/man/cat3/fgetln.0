     The ffggeettllnn() function returns a pointer to the next line from the stream
     referenced by _s_t_r_e_a_m. This line is _n_o_t a C string as it does not end with
     a terminating NUL character.  The length of the line, including the final
     newline, is stored in the memory location to which _l_e_n points.  (Note,
     however, that if the line is the last in a file that does not end in a
     newline, the returned text will not contain a newline.)

     Upon successful completion a pointer is returned; this pointer becomes
     invalid after the next I/O operation on _s_t_r_e_a_m (whether successful or
     not) or as soon as the stream is closed.  Otherwise, NULL is returned.
     The ffggeettllnn() function does not distinguish between end-of-file and error;
     the routines feof(3) and ferror(3) must be used to determine which oc-
     curred.  If an error occurs, the global variable _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate
     the error.  The end-of-file condition is remembered, even on a terminal,
     and all subsequent attempts to read will return NULL until the condition
     is cleared with clearerr(3).

     The text to which the returned pointer points may be modified, provided
     that no changes are made beyond the returned size.  These changes are
     lost as soon as the pointer becomes invalid.

EERRRROORRSS
     [EBADF]  The argument _s_t_r_e_a_m is not a stream open for reading.

     The ffggeettllnn() function may also fail and set _e_r_r_n_o for any of the errors
     specified for the routines fflush(3),  malloc(3),  read(2),  stat(2),  or
     realloc(3).

     The ffggeettllnn() function first appeared in 4.4BSD.
