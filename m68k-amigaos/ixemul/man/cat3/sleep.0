     The sslleeeepp() function suspends execution of the calling process until ei-
     ther the number of seconds specified by _s_e_c_o_n_d_s have elapsed or a signal
     is delivered to the calling process and its action is to invoke a signal-
     catching function or to terminate the process.  The suspension time may
     be longer than requested due to the scheduling of other activity by the
     system.

     If a timer is already running on the process its state is saved.  If the
     value _s_e_c_o_n_d_s is more than or equal to the remaining clock time for the
     saved timer, the sleep time is set to the remaining clock time.  The
     state of the previous timer is restored after _s_e_c_o_n_d_s has passed.

     This function is implemented using setitimer(2);  it requires eight sys-
     tem calls each time it is invoked.  A similar but less compatible func-
     tion can be obtained with a single select(2);  such a function would not
     restart after signals, but would not interfere with other uses of
     setitimer.

     If the sslleeeepp() function returns because the requested time has elapsed,
     the value returned will be zero.  If the sslleeeepp() function returns due to
     the delivery of a signal, the value returned will be the unslept amount
     (the request time minus the time actually slept) in seconds.
