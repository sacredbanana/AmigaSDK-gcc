     functions are provided for getting and setting the baud rate values in
     the termios structure.  The effects of the functions on the terminal as
     described below do not become effective, nor are all errors detected, un-
     til the ttccsseettaattttrr function is called.  Certain values for baud rates set
     in the termios structure and passed to ttccsseettaattttrr have special meanings.
     These are discussed in the portion of the manual page that describes the
     ttccsseettaattttrr function.

     The input and output baud rates are found in the termios structure.  The
     unsigned integer speed_t is typdef'd in the include file <_t_e_r_m_i_o_s_._h>. The
     value of the integer corresponds directly to the baud rate being repre-
     sented, however, the following symbolic values are defined.

     #define B0      0
     #define B50     50
     #define B75     75
     #define B110    110
     #define B134    134
     #define B150    150
     #define B200    200
     #define B300    300
     #define B600    600
     #define B1200   1200
     #define B1800   1800
     #define B2400   2400
     #define B4800   4800
     #define B9600   9600

     #define B38400  38400

     #define EXTA    19200
     #define EXTB    38400
     #endif  /*_POSIX_SOURCE */

     The ccffggeettiissppeeeedd function returns the input baud rate in the termios
     structure referenced by _t_p.

     The ccffsseettiissppeeeedd function sets the input baud rate in the termios struc-
     ture referenced by _t_p to _s_p_e_e_d.

     The ccffggeettoossppeeeedd function returns the output baud rate in the termios
     structure referenced by _t_p.

     The ccffsseettoossppeeeedd function sets the output baud rate in the termios struc-
     ture referenced by _t_p to _s_p_e_e_d.

     The ccffsseettssppeeeedd function sets both the input and output baud rate in the
     termios structure referenced by _t_p to _s_p_e_e_d.

     Upon successful completion, the functions ccffsseettiissppeeeedd, ccffsseettoossppeeeedd, and
     ccffsseettssppeeeedd return a value of 0.  Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned and
     the global variable _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the error.

     This section describes the functions that are used to control the general
     terminal interface.  Unless otherwise noted for a specific command, these
     functions are restricted from use by background processes.  Attempts to
     perform these operations shall cause the process group to be sent a SIGT-
     TOU signal.  If the calling process is blocking or ignoring SIGTTOU sig-
     nals, the process is allowed to perform the operation and the SIGTTOU
     signal is not sent.

     In all the functions, although _f_d is an open file descriptor, the func-
     tions affect the underlying terminal file, not just the open file de-
     scription associated with the particular file descriptor.

     The ccffmmaakkeerraaww function sets the flags stored in the termios structure to
     a state disabling all input and output processing, giving a ``raw I/O
     path.'' It should be noted that there is no function to reverse this ef-
     fect.  This is because there are a variety of processing options that
     could be re-enabled and the correct method is for an application to snap-
     shot the current terminal state using the function ttccggeettaattttrr, setting raw
     mode with ccffmmaakkeerraaww and the subsequent ttccsseettaattttrr, and then using another
     ttccsseettaattttrr with the saved state to revert to the previous terminal state.

     The ttccggeettaattttrr function copies the parameters associated with the terminal
     referenced by _f_d in the termios structure referenced by _t_p. This function
     is allowed from a background process, however, the terminal attributes
     may be subsequently changed by a foreground process.

     The ttccsseettaattttrr function sets the parameters associated with the terminal
     from the termios structure referenced by _t_p. The _a_c_t_i_o_n field is created
     by _o_r'ing the following values, as specified in the include file
     <_t_e_r_m_i_o_s_._h>.

     _T_C_S_A_N_O_W    The change occurs immediately.

     _T_C_S_A_D_R_A_I_N  The change occurs after all output written to _f_d has been
                transmitted to the terminal.  This value of _a_c_t_i_o_n should be


                used when changing parameters that affect output.

     _T_C_S_A_F_L_U_S_H  The change occurs after all output written to _f_d has been
                transmitted to the terminal Additionally, any input that has
                been received but not read is discarded.

     _T_C_S_A_S_O_F_T   If this value is _o_r'ed into the _a_c_t_i_o_n value, the values of
                the _c___c_f_l_a_g, _c___i_s_p_e_e_d, and _c___o_s_p_e_e_d fields are ignored.

     The 0 baud rate is used to terminate the connection.  If 0 is specified
     as the output speed to the function ttccsseettaattttrr, modem control will no
     longer be asserted on the terminal, disconnecting the terminal.

     If zero is specified as the input speed to the function ttccsseettaattttrr, the
     input baud rate will be set to the same value as that specified by the
     output baud rate.

     If ttccsseettaattttrr is unable able to make any of the requested changes, it re-
     turns -1 and sets _e_r_r_n_o. Otherwise, it makes all of the requested changes
     it can.  If the specified input and output baud rates differ and are a
     combination that is not supported, neither baud rate is changed.

     Upon successful completion, the functions ttccggeettaattttrr and ttccsseettaattttrr return
     a value of 0.  Otherwise, they return -1 and the global variable _e_r_r_n_o is
     set to indicate the error, as follows:

     [EBADF]       The _f_d argument to ttccggeettaattttrr or ttccsseettaattttrr was not a valid
                   file descriptor.

     [EINTR]       The ttccsseettaattttrr function was interrupted by a signal.

     [EINVAL]      The _a_c_t_i_o_n argument to the ttccsseettaattttrr function was not
                   valid, or an attempt was made to change an attribute repre-
                   sented in the termios structure to an unsupported value.

     [ENOTTY]      The file associated with the _f_d argument to ttccggeettaattttrr or
                   ttccsseettaattttrr is not a terminal.
