     sshhmmggeett() returns the shared memory identifier associated with the key
     _k_e_y.

     A shared memory segment is created if either _k_e_y is equal to IPC_PRIVATE,
     or _k_e_y does not have a shared memory segment identifier associated with
     it, and the IPC_CREAT bit is set in _s_h_m_f_l_g_.

     If a new shared memory segment is created, the data structure associated
     with it (the _s_h_m_i_d___d_s structure, see shmctl(2))  is initialized as fol-
     lows:

     ++oo   _s_h_m___p_e_r_m_._c_u_i_d and _s_h_m___p_e_r_m_._u_i_d are set to the effective uid of the
         calling process.

     ++oo   _s_h_m___p_e_r_m_._g_i_d and _s_h_m___p_e_r_m_._c_g_i_d are set to the effective gid of the
         calling process.

     ++oo   _s_h_m___p_e_r_m_._m_o_d_e is set to the lower 9 bits of _s_h_m_f_l_g.

     ++oo   _s_h_m___l_p_i_d, _s_h_m___n_a_t_t_c_h, _s_h_m___a_t_i_m_e, and _s_h_m___d_t_i_m_e are set to 0

     ++oo   _s_h_m___c_t_i_m_e is set to the current time.

     ++oo   _s_h_m___s_e_g_s_z is set to the value of _s_i_z_e.

     Upon successful completion a positive shared memory segment identifier is
     returned.  Otherwise, -1 is returned and the global variable _e_r_r_n_o is set
     to indicate the error.

     [EACESS]      A shared memory segment is already associated with _k_e_y and
                   the caller has no permission to access it.

     [EEXIST]      Both IPC_CREAT and IPC_EXCL are set in _s_h_m_f_l_g, and a shared
                   memory segment is already associated with _k_e_y.

     [ENOSPC]      A new shared memory indentifier could not be created be-
                   cause the system limit for the number of shared memory
                   identifiers has been reached.

     [ENOENT]      IPC_CREAT was not set in _s_h_m_f_l_g and no shared memory seg-
                   ment associated with _k_e_y was found.

     [ENOMEM]      There is not enough memory left to created a shared memory
                   segment of the requested size.
