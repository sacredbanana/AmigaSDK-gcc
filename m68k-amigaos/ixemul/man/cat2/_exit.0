     The __eexxiitt() function terminates a process with the following conse-
     quences:

     ++oo   All of the descriptors open in the calling process are closed.  This
         may entail delays, for example, waiting for output to drain; a pro-
         cess in this state may not be killed, as it is already dying.

     ++oo   If the parent process of the calling process has an outstanding wait
         call or catches the SIGCHLD signal, it is notified of the calling
         process's termination and the _s_t_a_t_u_s is set as defined by wait(2).

     ++oo   The parent process-ID of all of the calling process's existing child
         processes are set to 1; the initialization process (see the DEFINI-
         TIONS section of intro(2))  inherits each of these processes.

     ++oo   If the termination of the process causes any process group to become
         orphaned (usually because the parents of all members of the group
         have now exited; see ``orphaned process group'' in intro(2)),  and if
         any member of the orphaned group is stopped, the SIGHUP signal and
         the SIGCONT signal are sent to all members of the newly-orphaned pro-
         cess group.

     ++oo   If the process is a controlling process (see intro(2)),  the SIGHUP
         signal is sent to the foreground process group of the controlling
         terminal, and all current access to the controlling terminal is re-
         voked.

     Most C programs call the library routine exit(3),  which flushes buffers,
     closes streams, unlinks temporary files, etc., before calling __eexxiitt().
