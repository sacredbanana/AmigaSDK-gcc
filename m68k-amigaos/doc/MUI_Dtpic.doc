	The Dtpic class allows including arbitrary images loadable using
	datatypes.library in MUI applications. One just as to provide the file name
	of an image. Everything else is handled by the Dtpic class. Full
	transparency and alpha channel is supported.
Dtpic.mui/MUIA_Dtpic_Alpha
    NAME
	MUIA_Dtpic_Alpha -- (V20) [ISG], LONG, 0x8042b4db

    FUNCTION
	Specify an additional alpha value to be applied when blitting the loaded
	image onto the screen. The value of MUIA_Dtpic_Alpha is an 8bit value
	specifying the intensity of the alpha blitting. You usually want to specify
	0xff. Alpha blitting won't work on CLUT (i.e. depth <= 8 bit) screens.
Dtpic.mui/MUIA_Dtpic_DarkenSelState
    NAME
	MUIA_Dtpic_DarkenSelState -- (V20) [I.G], BOOL, 0x80423247

    FUNCTION
	If set to TRUE the image's brightness will decreased by 50% whenever the
	left mouse button is pressed on the object.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Dtpic_LightenOnMouse
Dtpic.mui/MUIA_Dtpic_Fade
    NAME
	MUIA_Dtpic_Fade -- (V20) [ISG], LONG, 0x80420429

    FUNCTION
	Setting this attribute to a positive value while also changing the image's alpha
	value will let Dtpic class do a fade between the previous and the new alpha
	value. This allows images to be faded in our out. Depending on the fading
	direction between the current and the final alpha value the specified value will
	be repeatedly added or subtracted respectively to the current alpha value with a
	delay of 20ms until the final alpha value has been reached.

	For negative values the fading process will be stopped and the final alpha value
	will be set immediately.

    EXAMPLE
	// fade out the image within approx. half a second
	SetAttrs(obj,
	  MUIA_Dtpic_Fade, 255/20,
	  MUIA_Dtpic_Alpha, 0x00,
	  TAG_DONE);

    SEE ALSO

Dtpic.mui/MUIA_Dtpic_LightenOnMouse
    NAME
	MUIA_Dtpic_LightenOnMouse -- (V20) [I.G], BOOL, 0x8042966a

    FUNCTION
	If set to TRUE the image's brightness will increased by 20% whenever the
	mouse is moved over the object.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Dtpic_DarkenSelState
Dtpic.mui/MUIA_Dtpic_Name
    NAME
	MUIA_Dtpic_Name -- (V18) [ISG], STRPTR, 0x80423d72

    FUNCTION
	Specify the name of the image file to be loaded using datatypes.library. This
	attribute is absolutely required.

	Dtpic class will remember the passed string pointer during OM_NEW and OM_SET,
	but the string will NOT be copied. Thus the pointer must stay valid as long as
	the object lives. To change the image later you MUST use a different string
	buffer as Dtpic class will refuse to accept the old string buffer a second time.
	Finally, NULL is NO valid value for this attribute.
