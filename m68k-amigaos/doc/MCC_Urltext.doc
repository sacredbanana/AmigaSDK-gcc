   Urltext.mcc is an deprecated and obsolete 3rd-party MUI custom class. New
   applications should use Hyperlink.mcc which includes all functionality of
   Urltext.mcc, but also offers additional features and a cleaned up API. The
   main difference between the two classes is that Hyperlink.mcc is a direct
   subclass of MUI's internal Text.mui class. Hence it automatically supports
   all of Text.mui's attributes and method automatically.

   For convenience MUI5 provides two ways for old applications and old code to
   wrap over Urltext.mcc API usage automatically. This makes migrating to the
   new Hyperlink.mcc class easy and seamlessly, for both users and developers.

   This document is targetted at developers who need to know the exact
   differences between the two APIs and how they are performing the wrapping
   exactly. This document is not meant as a reference for each obsolete
   attribute and method. For convenience the full old documentation of all
   attributes and methods is still included. However, please obey the
   differences described below.



   Urltext.mcc API wrapper
   -----------------------

   The Urltext.mcc API wrapper allows old legacy code to make use of
   Hyperlink.mcc instead of Urltext.mcc transparently without any code change at
   all.

   The wrapper is included in "mui/Urltext_mcc.h" and can be enabled by
   defining the symbol "USE_HYPERLINK_MCC", either ahead of the #include
   directive or via command line parameter when invoking the compiler.
   In case of the GNU compiler this is "-DUSE_HYPERLINK_MCC", which usually can
   be part of a CFLAGS variable in the project's Makefile.

   This works well for all common Urltext.mcc use cases. However, some obsolete
   attributes are not handled and will be ignored.

       MUIA_Urltext_Url            - wrapped to MUIA_Hyperlink_URI

           No notification will be triggered on this attribute if the user
           hovers the object with the mouse pointer due to the redefinition
           to an attribute of Hyperlink.mcc. This 'feature' is an inconsistency
           and design flaw of the original API and is not supported by this
           class. It cannot be handled by the API wrapper automatically. If the
           to be ported application depends on the hover notifications then
           MUIA_Hyperlink_HoverTip can be used, which has been introduced for
           exactly this purpose.

       MUIA_Urltext_Text           - wrapped to MUIA_Text_Contents
       MUIA_Urltext_SetMax         - wrapped to MUIA_Text_SetMax
       MUIA_Urltext_Active         - ignored
       MUIA_Urltext_Visited        - ignored
       MUIA_Urltext_Underline      - ignored
       MUIA_Urltext_FallBack       - ignored
       MUIA_Urltext_DoVisitedPen   - ignored
       MUIA_Urltext_DoOpenURL      - ignored

           All these attribute of the original API are obsolete, because the
           original purpose of Urltext.mcc was to open URLs. If the old code
           depends on one of these attributes then MUIM_Urltext_OpenURL can be
           overloaded or the default notification on MUIA_Pressed becoming FALSE
           can be reversed with a MUIM_KillNotify call.

       MUIA_Urltext_NoMenu         - ignored

           MUIA_Context_Menu can be set to NULL value to disable the menu. This
           also works with the original 68k version of Urltext.mcc.

       MUIA_Urltext_NoOpenURLPrefs - ignored

       MUIM_Urltext_OpenURL        - wrapped to MUIM_Hyperlink_Follow
       MUIM_Urltext_Copy           - wrapped to MUIM_Hyperlink_Copy



    Urltext.mcc binary wrapper
    --------------------------

    MUI5 includes a dummy Urltext.mcc implementation which serves as a wrapper
    for Hyperlink.mcc for old legacy applications which use Urltext.mcc
    directly. New applications should not depend on this wrapper.

    The binary wrapper implements all relevant Urltext.mcc attributes and
    methods (including certain design flaws) to provide a fully compatible
    drop-in replacement for the original 3rd-party Urltext.mcc class.

    There are just a few attributes which are considered obsolete and therefore
    are no longer supported and will be ignored. Other attributes have limited
    functionality.

        MUIA_Urltext_Url            - fully emulated, including hover
                                      notifications
        MUIA_Urltext_Text           - fully emulated
        MUIA_Urltext_SetMax         - fully emulated
        MUIA_Urltext_Active         - always returns TRUE, OpenURL is
                                      considered to be always available
        MUIA_Urltext_Visited        - returns TRUE, when object was clicked
                                      once
        MUIA_Urltext_Underline      - ignored for consistency reasons
        MUIA_Urltext_FallBack       - ignored, see MUIA_Urltext_Active
        MUIA_Urltext_DoVisitedPen   - ignored
        MUIA_Urltext_DoOpenURL      - fully emulated
        MUIA_Urltext_NoMenu         - fully emulated
        MUIA_Urltext_NoOpenURLPrefs - ignored

        MUIM_Urltext_OpenURL        - fully emulated
        MUIM_Urltext_Copy           - fully emulated
Urltext.mcc/MUIA_Urltext_Active

   NAME
   MUIA_Urltext_Active -- [..G.], BOOL

   FUNCTION
   Urltext.mcc needs openurl.library installed and configured to work. This
   attribute is set to TRUE if OpenURL in installed or FALSE otherwise.
Urltext.mcc/MUIA_Urltext_DoOpenURL

   NAME
   MUIA_Urltext_DoOpenURL -- [I...], BOOL

   FUNCTION
   If this attribute is set to TRUE the URL is opened when the user clicks the
   object. If it is set to FALSE nothing will happen.

   Defaults to TRUE.
Urltext.mcc/MUIA_Urltext_DoVisitedPen

   NAME
   MUIA_Urltext_DoVisitedPen -- [I...], BOOL

   FUNCTION
   This attribute defines how the URL text is displayed after the object was
   clicked at least once. If set to TRUE the user defined color from the
   preferences will be used.

   Defaults to TRUE.

   NOTE
   This attribute overrides the user preferences and hence should be used only
   if absolutely necessary.
Urltext.mcc/MUIA_Urltext_FallBack

   NAME
   MUIA_Urltext_Fallback -- [I...], BOOL

   FUNCTION
   This attribute defines how the URL text is displayed in case OpenURL is not
   installed. If OpenURL is installed this attribute will be ignored. Without
   OpenURL and this attribute set to FALSE the URL text will be drawn with the
   default MUI text pen and the object does not accept clicks. If OpenURL is not
   installed and this attribute is set to TRUE the URL text will be drawn as if
   OpenURL was installed, but the object will still not accept clicks.

   NOTE
   This attribute overrides the user preferences and hence should be used only
   if absolutely necessary.
Urltext.mcc/MUIA_Urltext_NoMenu

   NAME
   MUIA_Urltext_NoMenu -- [I...], BOOL

   FUNCTION
   Urltext.mcc object offer a context menu. Set this attribute to TRUE if you
   don't want the internal context menu to be displayed. A custom context menu
   can still be created.

   Defaults to FALSE.
Urltext.mcc/MUIA_Urltext_NoOpenURLPrefs

   NAME
   MUIA_Urltext_NoOpenURLPrefs -- [I...], BOOL

   FUNCTION
   If this attribute is set to TRUE the internal context menu will not include
   the "OpenURL prefs" item.

   Defaults to FALSE.
Urltext.mcc/MUIA_Urltext_SetMax

   NAME
   MUIA_Urltext_SetMax -- [I...], BOOL

   FUNCTION

Urltext.mcc/MUIA_Urltext_Text

   NAME
   MUIA_Urltext_Text -- [ISGN], CONST_STRPTR

   FUNCTION
   This is the tet to be shown. If it is not specified or is set to NULL then
   the URL passed to MUIA_Urltext_Url will be used. The maximum length is 256
   characters including the terminating NUL byte. The supplied string will be
   copied internally. All escape codes of the MUI text engine are supported.

   SEE ALSO
   MUIA_Urltext_Url
Urltext.mcc/MUIA_Urltext_Underline

   NAME
   MUIA_Urltext_Underline -- [I...], BOOL

   FUNCTION
   Define whether the text will be underlined.

   NOTE
   This attribute overrides the user preferences and hence should be used only
   if absolutely necessary.
Urltext.mcc/MUIA_Urltext_Url

   NAME
   MUIA_Urltext_Url -- [ISGN], CONST_STRPTR


   FUNCTION
   The URL to be shown. The maximum length is 256 characters including the
   terminating NUL byte. The supplied string will be copied internally. When the
   mouse is hovering the object this attribute will get a notification with the
   current URL string. When the mouse if not hovering the object this attribute
   will get a notification of NULL.

   The supplied string will be used instead of MUIA_Urltext_Text if that
   attribute is omitted or NULL.
