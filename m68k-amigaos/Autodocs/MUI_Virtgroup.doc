	Virtgroup class generates special kinds of group objects whose
	children can be a lot larger than the actual group. The group
	acts as a (small) window through which a rectangle area of its
	contents is visible.

	During layout, MUI tries to place the children of a virtual 
	group in the visible part. If this is impossible, space is
	extended as long as all children fit.

	Virtual groups themselves don't offer any scrollbars to allow
	user interaction. These things are handled by scrollgroup class.
	Usually, you don't want to use a virtual group without a
	scrollgroup.
Virtgroup.mui/MUIA_Virtgroup_Height

    NAME
	MUIA_Virtgroup_Height -- (V6 ) [..G], LONG

    FUNCTION
	Read the virtual height of a virtual group.
	This attribute is quite senseless, better use
	a scrollgroup object to control the virtual group.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Virtgroup_Width, MUIA_Virtgroup_Left, MUIA_Virtgroup_Top
Virtgroup.mui/MUIA_Virtgroup_Input

    NAME
	MUIA_Virtgroup_Input -- (V11) [I..], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	Specify if a virtual group should be moveable by clicking
	into it and dragging the mouse. Defaults to TRUE.
Virtgroup.mui/MUIA_Virtgroup_Left

    NAME
	MUIA_Virtgroup_Left -- (V6 ) [ISG], LONG

    FUNCTION
	Get/set the virtual left edge of a virtual group.
	The left edge will automatically be clipped to
	be between 0 and (VirtualWidth-DisplayWidth).

	This attribute is quite senseless, better use
	a scrollgroup object to control the virtual group.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Virtgroup_Width, MUIA_Virtgroup_Height, MUIA_Virtgroup_Top
Virtgroup.mui/MUIA_Virtgroup_Top

    NAME
	MUIA_Virtgroup_Top -- (V6 ) [ISG], LONG

    FUNCTION
	Get/set the virtual top edge of a virtual group.
	The top edge will automatically be clipped to
	be between 0 and (VirtualTop-DisplayTop).

	This attribute is quite senseless, better use
	a scrollgroup object to control the virtual group.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Virtgroup_Width, MUIA_Virtgroup_Height, MUIA_Virtgroup_Left

Virtgroup.mui/MUIA_Virtgroup_Width

    NAME
	MUIA_Virtgroup_Width -- (V6 ) [..G], LONG

    FUNCTION
	Read the virtual width of a virtual group.
	This attribute is quite senseless, better use
	a scrollgroup object to control the virtual group.
