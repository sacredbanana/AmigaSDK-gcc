    NAME
        boingball_ic -- create boing ball BOOPSI objects

    SUPERCLASS
        penmap.image

    REQUIRES
        penmap.image

    DESCRIPTION
        The boingball.image class is used to display images of an Amiga-
        style boing ball, with optional animation.

        Currently, this image is 24*24 pixels, but only the central 16*16
        area has imagery (the rest being transparent). Currently, there are 6
        frames of animation.

    METHODS
        OM_NEW -- Passed to superclass to create object instance.

        IM_MOVE -- Render the next frame of the animation sequence.

    ATTRIBUTES
        This class has no attributes of its own. See
        <intuition/imageclass.h> and <gadgets/penmap.h> for supported
        attributes.

        Note that you *must* specify a valid PENMAP_Screen when creating
        the boingball.image object.

    BUGS
        Versions lower than V47 do not work and should not be used.
