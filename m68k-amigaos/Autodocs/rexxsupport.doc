    NAME
	rexxsupport.library

    This library provides several support and utility functions for
    ARexx. If you want to use functions that are included in this library,
    it needs to be added explicitly to ARexx to make it aware of its
    functions. The following AmigaDOS command will import the function
    definitions in here:

	rxlib rexxsupport.library 0 -30 0

    Alternatively, the library can also be added within a Rexx script
    as follows:

	rv = ADDLIB('rexxmathlib.library',0,-30,0)

	rv is a boolean value that indicates success.

rexxsupport.library/ALLOCMEM                     rexxsupport.library/ALLOCMEM

	specifies memory requires as given in <exec/memory.h>. If not
	given, public memory (requirements = 1) is requested.

rexxsupport.library/BADDR                           rexxsupport.library/BADDR

	has not been found.
	If the separator is given, then the resources are separated it.

rexxsupport.library/TYPEPKT                       rexxsupport.library/TYPEPKT

    NAME
	TYPEPKT - returns a type of an Arexx command packet

    SYNOPSIS
	rv = TYPEPKT(pkt,[mode])

    FUNCTION
	Returns the type of an ARexx command packet whose address is given
	as address string as first argument.
	If the mode argument is omitted, then the return value is a number
	that indicates the type in packed form, also available separately
	through specifying various modes.

	The mode can be one of the following:
	    'A'	 -   Returns the number of arguments of the packet
	    	     also as byte 0 of the packed result.
	    'C'	 -   Returns TRUE if the packet was created as
	    	     command rather than function. This information
		     is also available as byte 3 of the packed result,
		     which is '01'x for commands.
	    'F'  -   Returns TRUE if the packet was created as
	    	     function  call. This information is also available
		     as byte 3 of the packed result, which is '02'x for
		     function calls.
	 Byte 2 are modifier flags that are handled automatically by the
	 REPLY function.

rexxsupport.library/WAITPKT                       rexxsupport.library/WAITPKT

    NAME
	WAITPKT - wait for a ARexx command packet on a named port

    SYNOPSIS
	rv = WAITPKT(portname)

    FUNCTION
	Waits on the port whose name is given as argument for an
	ARexx command packet to arrive. Returns non-zero if a packet is
	available, but does not remove it. Use GETPKT for this.
