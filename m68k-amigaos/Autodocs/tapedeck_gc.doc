    NAME
        tapedeck.gadget -- tape deck controller class

    SUPERCLASS
        gadgetclass

    REQUIRES
        propgclass, frameiclass

    DESCRIPTION
        The tape deck controller class enables the user to select from
        a set of buttons much like those found on a tape deck or DVD
        player. There are two types of tape deck controller objects that
        may be created depending on the TDECK_Tape attribute.

        The default tape deck object has five buttons: rewind, play,
        fast forward, stop and pause. The animation mode tape deck has
        four buttons: rewind, play, fast forward and a frame control
        slider.
