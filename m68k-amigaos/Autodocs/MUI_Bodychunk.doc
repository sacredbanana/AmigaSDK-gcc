	Big and colorful images (e.g. About-Logos) usually take lots
	of space when stored in a traditional BitMap structure. To
	save memory, you can decide to have the picture compressed
	in your code and use the Bodychunk class instead of the
	Bitmap class for displaying. MUI will then automatically
	decompress your image when its about to appear in a
	window.

	Since Bodychunk class is a subclass of Bitmap class, you can
	of course use all the Bitmaps remapping and transparency
	features.

    NAME
	MUIA_Bodychunk_Body -- (V8 ) [ISG], UBYTE *

    FUNCTION
	Specify a pointer to the BODY data of your picture. This BODY
	data must follow normal IFF/ILBM conventions.

	You have to supply MUIA_Bitmap_Width, MUIA_Bitmap_Height and
	MUIA_Bodychunk_Depth to describe the contents of the BODY
	data, otherwise MUI will fail to decompress it.

	Body data may be shared between different Bodychunk objects
	and does not need to be in chip ram.

Bodychunk.mui/MUIA_Bodychunk_Compression

    NAME
	MUIA_Bodychunk_Compression -- (V8 ) [ISG], UBYTE

    FUNCTION
	MUI is able to uncompress byte&run compressed BODY chunks
	automatically. If your data is compressed, you must
	supply a value of cmpByteRun1 (==1) for this tag. Other
	compression techniques are not supported.

	Omitting this tag or setting it to 0 indicates that the
	BODY data is uncompressed. Using the Bodychunk class
	doesn't make much sense in this case since its main
	purpose is to save memory for big images.

Bodychunk.mui/MUIA_Bodychunk_Depth

    NAME
	MUIA_Bodychunk_Depth -- (V8 ) [ISG], LONG

    FUNCTION
	Specify the depth of your picture here. This tag is
	required for correct BODY chunk parsing. Also remember
	to use MUIA_Bodychunk_Masking if your BODY data contains
	a masking bitplane.

    NAME
	MUIA_Bodychunk_Masking -- (V8 ) [ISG], UBYTE

    FUNCTION
	You must indicate if your BODY data contains a masking
	plane. Currently, MUI does not use this masking plane
	for any purpose, but this attribute is required to
	allow correct parsing of the BODY data.
