	Family class is the base class for objects that are able
	to handle a list of children. This is e.g. the case for
	MUIs Menustrip, Menu and Menuitem objects.

	Family class defines methods and attributes to
	add and remove children, sort children, and transfer
	children to other Family objects.

	Group class and application class should also be a
	subclass of Family class, but due to BOOPSI system
	limitations, this is currently impossible. If the
	future will allow more logical class trees, things
	might change, but everything will be done in a
	compatible manner.
Family.mui/MUIA_Family_Child

    NAME
	MUIA_Family_Child -- (V8 ) [I..], Object *

    FUNCTION
	You supply a pointer to a previously created MUI object
	here. This object will be added to family at family
	creation time.

	Of course you can specify any number of child objects,
	limited only by available memory.

	Normally, the value for a MUIA_Family_Child tag is
	a direct call to another MUI_NewObject(), children
	are generated "on the fly".

	When a family is disposed, all of its children will also
	get deleted. If you supply a NULL pointer as child,
	the family object will fail and previously dispose all
	valid children found in the taglist.

	This behaviour makes it possible to generate a complete
	family within one single (but long) MUI_NewObject()
	call. Error checking is not necessary since every error,
	even if it occurs in a very deep nesting level, will
	cause the complete call to fail without leaving back
	any previously created object.

    NOTES
	As a special case, MUIA_Group_Child is also recognized
	and treated as MUIA_Family_Child.

Family.mui/MUIA_Family_List

    NAME
	MUIA_Family_List -- (V8 ) [..G], struct MinList *

    FUNCTION
	Returns a pointer to a struct MinList which contains the children
	of a family object. You must parse this list with 
	intuition.library/NextObject().

    NAME
	MUIM_Family_AddHead (V8 )

    SYNOPSIS
	DoMethod(obj,MUIM_Family_AddHead,Object *obj);

    FUNCTION
	Add an object as first object to the family.
	Subclasses of family class usually define which
	types of objects are possible within their family.

    INPUTS
	obj - the object to be added.

Family.mui/MUIM_Family_AddTail

    NAME
	MUIM_Family_AddTail (V8 )

    SYNOPSIS
	DoMethod(obj,MUIM_Family_AddTail,Object *obj);

    FUNCTION
	Add an object as last object to the family.
	Subclasses of family class usually define which
	types of objects are possible within their family.

	This method does the same as OM_ADDMEMBER.

    INPUTS
	obj - the object to be added.

	MUIM_Family_Remove, MUIA_Family_Child
Family.mui/MUIM_Family_Insert

    NAME
	MUIM_Family_Insert (V8 )

    SYNOPSIS
	DoMethod(obj,MUIM_Family_Insert,Object *obj, Object *pred);

    FUNCTION
	Add an object after another object to the family.
	Subclasses of family class usually define which
	types of objects are possible within their family.

    INPUTS
	obj  - the object to be added.
	pred - the new object is inserted *after* this
	       object. pred must of course be a member
	       of the family.

    NAME
	MUIM_Family_Remove (V8 )

    SYNOPSIS
	DoMethod(obj,MUIM_Family_Remove,Object *obj);

    FUNCTION
	Remove an object from a family.

	This method does the same as OM_REMMEMBER.

    INPUTS
	obj - the object to be removed.

    NAME
	MUIM_Family_Sort (V8 )

    SYNOPSIS
	DoMethod(obj,MUIM_Family_Sort,Object *obj[1]);

    FUNCTION
	Sort the children of a family.

    INPUTS
	child - array that contains *all* the children of the
	        family in the desired order. The array must be
	        terminated with a NULL entry.

    NAME
	MUIM_Family_Transfer (V8 )

    SYNOPSIS
