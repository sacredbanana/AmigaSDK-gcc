	Area class is a super class for every other MUI class
	except windows and applications. It holds information
	about an objects current position, size and weight
	and manages frames, fonts and backgrounds.

	Additionally, area class handles the user input. By
	setting an objects MUIA_InputMode, you can make it
	behave like a button or like a toggle gadget. That's
	why MUI doesn't offer an extra button class. A button
	is simply a text object with a raised frame and a relverify
	input mode. Since especially group class is a subclass
	of area, you can create rather complex buttons consisting
	of many other display elements.
Area.mui/MUIA_Background

    NAME
	MUIA_Background -- (V4 ) [IS.], LONG

    FUNCTION
	Adjust the background for an object.

	Every MUI object has its own background setting.
	The background is displayed "behind" the actual
	object contents, e.g. behind a the text of a
	text object or behind the image of an image object.

	This attribute takes the same values as MUIA_Image_Spec,
	please refer to autodocs of image class for a complete
	description.

	An object without a specific background setting will
	inherit the pattern from its parent group. The default
	background for a window and many other background
	patterns are adjustable with the preferences program.

	Only a few MUII_xxxxxxx tags make sense as background.
	Important are:

	MUII_ButtonBack:
	   You have to set this when you create a button gadget.
	   Thus, your button will be displayed in the users
	   preferred style.

	MUII_TextBack:
	   Set this when you create a text object with a TextFrame,
	   e.g. some kind of status line. Do *not* use MUII_TextBack
	   for simple text without frame (e.g. gadget labels).

	MUII_BACKGROUND
	MUII_SHADOW
	MUII_SHINE
	MUII_FILL
	MUII_SHADOWBACK
	MUII_SHADOWFILL
	MUII_SHADOWSHINE
	MUII_FILLBACK
	MUII_FILLSHINE
	MUII_SHINEBACK
	MUII_SHINEBACK2:
	   One of MUI's predefined pattern. These are not
	   configurable by the user and will always look the
	   same.

	Note: It is *important* that you test your programs with
	      a fancy pattern configuration. With the default
	      setting you won't notice any errors in your backgrounds.
Area.mui/MUIA_BottomEdge

    NAME
	MUIA_BottomEdge -- (V4 ) [..G], LONG

    FUNCTION
	You can use this to read the current position and
	dimension of an object, if you e.g. need it to pop
	up some requester below.

	Of course, this attribute is only valid when the
	parent window of the object is currently open.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_TopEdge, MUIA_Width, MUIA_Height,
	MUIA_RightEdge, MUIA_LeftEdge
Area.mui/MUIA_ContextMenu

    NAME
	MUIA_ContextMenu -- (V11) [ISG], Object *

    FUNCTION
	Specifies a context sensitive popup menu for the current
	object. For MUI, popup menus are nothing else but standard
	intuition menus, so you must specify a pointer to a
	MUI menustrip object (e.g. something returned from
	MUI_MakeObject(MUIO_MenustripNM,...)) here.

	Whenever the user hits the RMB and the mouse is above the parent
	object, MUI will present the popup menu instead of the windows
	menu.

	Note: MUI will *not* dispose the MUIA_ContextMenu object when
	the object is disposed. You must take care of the menustrip
	object yourself. This is because menustrip objects of
	MUIA_ContextMenu do not actually "belong" to their parent
	objects, it's just a "reference". You are allowed to use
	a single menustrip object as MUIA_ContextMenu for different
	objects of the same window. Do *not* share with objects in
	other windows or with the default menu of a window or
	an application!

	If the user selects an item, the object will receive
	a MUIM_ContextMenuChoice method containing the selected
	menuitem object. If you built your menustrip tree with
	MUI_MakeObject(MUIO_MenustripNM,...), you will find the
	nm_UserData of your menu entry in muiUserData(menuitem).
	If you have control over methods because you are a
	subclass, you can immediately take approriate actions 
	when receiving MUIM_ContextMenuChoice.

	If you dont have a subclass or dont override
	MUIM_ContextMenuChoice, the method will finally reach
	area class and will set the attribute MUIA_ContextMenuTrigger
	to the appropriate menuitem object. This allows you to react on
	context menu selections by simple notification and eliminates
	the need of writing a subclass just for this purpose.

	Note: Subclasses are always the better solution!

	There is also a possibility to dynamically create popup menus
	on the fly. See MUIM_ContextMenuBuild for details.

    NOTES
	MUI uses the same tree-like technique as always (e.g. with
	drag&drop) to find out whichs context menu to use on a
	certain mouse position. This allows you to have a context
	menu for a group and different context menus for its
	children. The MUI preferences program makes use of that
	feature by allowing to control a single gadget or a whole
	page of gadgets with popup menus.

Area.mui/MUIA_ContextMenuTrigger

    NAME
	MUIA_ContextMenuTrigger -- (V11) [..G], Object *

    FUNCTION
	Allows reacting on context menus with notificaton.
	When the MUIM_ContextMenuChoice method reaches area class
	because you did not override it in a subclass, it sets
	MUIA_ContextMenuTrigger to the received paremeter which
	is a pointer to the user-selected menuitem object.

	See MUIA_ContextMenu for details.

Area.mui/MUIA_ControlChar

    NAME
	MUIA_ControlChar -- (V4 ) [ISG], char

    FUNCTION
	Pressing the control char will have the same effect
	as pressing return if the object was active.
	
	This can be used to create old style key shortcuts.

	Note: Using an uppercase control char will force
	      the user to press shift.

	mui.h / KeyButton() macro
Area.mui/MUIA_CycleChain

    NAME
	MUIA_CycleChain -- (V11) [ISG], LONG

    FUNCTION
	MUI 3 introduces a new keyboard cycle chain system. All you 
	have to do is to set  MUIA_CycleChain to 1 for every object 
	that you want to have in your chain, MUI does the rest 
	automatically. The old MUIM_Window_SetCycleChain will continue 
	to work but is considered obsolete.

    SEE ALSO
	Window.mui/MUIM_Window_SetCycleChain
Area.mui/MUIA_Disabled

    NAME
	MUIA_Disabled -- (V4 ) [ISG], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	Disable or enable a gadget. Setting this attribute
	causes a gadget to become disabled, it gets a ghost
	pattern and doesn't respond to user input any longer.

	Disabled gadgets cannot be activated with the TAB key.

	Using MUIA_Disable on a group of objects will disable
	all objects within that group.

    EXAMPLE
	/* we have a radio button gadget with three         */
	/* entries, the third should enable a string gadget */
	/* with additional parameters                       */

	DoMethod(radio, MUIM_Notify, MUIA_Radio_Active, 0,
	   string, 3, MUIM_Set, MUIA_Disabled, TRUE);

	DoMethod(radio, MUIM_Notify, MUIA_Radio_Active, 1,
	   string, 3, MUIM_Set, MUIA_Disabled, TRUE);

	DoMethod(radio, MUIM_Notify, MUIA_Radio_Active, 2,
	   string, 3, MUIM_Set, MUIA_Disabled, FALSE);
Area.mui/MUIA_Draggable

    NAME
	MUIA_Draggable -- (V11) [ISG], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	Set this if you want the complete object to be
	dragable for D&D operations.
Area.mui/MUIA_Dropable

    NAME
	MUIA_Dropable -- (V11) [ISG], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	Only objects with this attribute set to TRUE will be asked
	if they want to become an active Drag & Drop destination
	at all. Though this attribute defaults to TRUE, this doesnt
	mean that every object automatically aceppts D&D actions,
	because the MUIM_DragQuery method is answered FALSE when
	it arrives at area class.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIM_DragQuery
Area.mui/MUIA_ExportID

    NAME
	MUIA_ExportID -- (V4 ) [ISG], ULONG (OBSOLETE)

    FUNCTION
	Objects with a non NULL MUIA_ExportID export their
	contents during MUIM_Application_Save and import
	them during MUIM_Application_Load.

	You have to use different ExportIDs for your objects!

    NOTE
	This attribute is renamed to MUIA_ObjectID since
	muimaster.library V12.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIM_Application_Save, MUIM_Application_Load
Area.mui/MUIA_FillArea

    NAME
	MUIA_FillArea -- (V4 ) [IS.], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	Set this if you are a custom class and dont want area class to
	clear your background during the DoSuperMethod() in your
	draw method. Note that if you set this, your draw method
	is responsible for filling every pixel of your objects
	rectangle, otherwise some display trash will remain there.
Area.mui/MUIA_FixHeight

    NAME
	MUIA_FixHeight -- (V4 ) [I..], LONG

    FUNCTION
	Give your object a fixed pixel height. This tag is
	absolutely not needed in a general MUI application
	and only present for emergency situations. Please
	think twice before using it!

    EXAMPLE
	/* create an 8x8 pixel rectangle with FILLPEN */

	RectangleObject,
	   MUIA_FixWidth  , 8,
	   MUIA_FixHeight , 8,
	   MUIA_Background, MUII_FILL,
	   End;

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_FixWidth, MUIA_FixWidthTxt, MUIA_FixHeightTxt
Area.mui/MUIA_FixHeightTxt

    NAME
	MUIA_FixHeightTxt -- (V4 ) [I..], STRPTR

    FUNCTION
	Give your object a fixed pixel height. The height
	will match the height of the given string. This tag is
	absolutely not needed in a general MUI application
	and only present for emergency situations. Please
	think twice before using it!

    EXAMPLE
	/* create a fixed size rectangle with FILLPEN */

	RectangleObject,
	   MUIA_FixWidthTxt , "00:00:00",
	   MUIA_FixHeightTxt, "\n\n",
	   MUIA_Background  , MUII_FILL,

    FUNCTION
	Give your object a fixed pixel width. This tag is
	absolutely not needed in a general MUI application
	and only present for emergency situations. Please
	think twice before using it!

    EXAMPLE
	/* create an 8x8 pixel rectangle with FILLPEN */

	RectangleObject,

    FUNCTION
	Give your object a fixed pixel width. The width
	will match the width of the given string. This tag is
	absolutely not needed in a general MUI application
	and only present for emergency situations. Please
	think twice before using it!

    EXAMPLE

Area.mui/MUIA_Font

    NAME
	MUIA_Font -- (V4 ) [I.G], struct TextFont *

    SPECIAL INPUTS
	MUIV_Font_Inherit
	MUIV_Font_Normal
	MUIV_Font_List
	MUIV_Font_Tiny
	MUIV_Font_Fixed
	MUIV_Font_Title
	MUIV_Font_Big
	MUIV_Font_Button

    FUNCTION
	Every MUI object can have its own font, just set it with
	this tag. Objects without an explicit font setting will
	inherit it from their parent group.

	You normally won't need to open a font yourself, just
	use one of the predefined values to get a font from
	the users preferences.

    EXAMPLE
	/* since the text contains tabs,           */
	/* use the fixed width font for displaying */

	msgread = FloattextObject,
	   MUIA_Font, MUIV_Font_Fixed,
	   ...,
	   End;
Area.mui/MUIA_Frame

    NAME
	MUIA_Frame -- (V4 ) [I..], LONG

    SPECIAL INPUTS
	MUIV_Frame_None
	MUIV_Frame_Button
	MUIV_Frame_ImageButton
	MUIV_Frame_Text
	MUIV_Frame_String
	MUIV_Frame_ReadList
	MUIV_Frame_InputList
	MUIV_Frame_Prop
	MUIV_Frame_Gauge
	MUIV_Frame_Group
	MUIV_Frame_PopUp
	MUIV_Frame_Virtual
	MUIV_Frame_Slider
	MUIV_Frame_Count

    FUNCTION
	Define a frame for the current object. Since area class
	is a superclass for all elements in a window, you can
	assign frames to every object you wish.

	You don't adjust the style of your frame directly,
	instead you only specify a type:

	MUIV_Frame_Button
	   for standard buttons with text in it.

	MUIV_Frame_ImageButton
	   for small buttons with images, e.g. the arrows
	   of a scrollbar.

	MUIV_Frame_Text
	   for a text field, e.g. a status line display.

	MUIV_Frame_String
	   for a string gadget.

	MUIV_Frame_ReadList
	   for a read only list.

	MUIV_Frame_InputList
	   for a list that handles input (has a cursor).

	MUIV_Frame_Prop
	   for proportional gadgets.

	MUIV_Frame_Group
	   for groups.

	How the frame is going to look is adjustable via the
	preferences program.

	Four spacing values belong to each frame that tell
	MUI how many pixels should be left free between the
	frame and its contents. These spacing values are also
	user adjustable as long as you don't override them
	with one of MUIA_InnerLeft, MUIA_InnerRight, MUIA_InnerTop,
	or MUIA_InnerBottom.

	Note: The first object in a window (MUIA_Window_RootObject)
	      may *not* have a frame. If you need this you will have
	      to create a dummy group with just one child.

    EXAMPLE
	strobj = StringObject,
	   MUIA_Frame, MUIV_Frame_String,
	   End;

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_InnerLeft, MUIA_InnerRight, MUIA_InnerTop,
	MUIA_InnerBottom
Area.mui/MUIA_FramePhantomHoriz

    NAME
	MUIA_FramePhantomHoriz -- (V4 ) [I..], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	Setting this to TRUE causes the specified frame to be
	a horizontal phantom frame. The frame will not appear
	but its vertical components (frame height, inner
	top and inner bottom spacing) will be used to calculate
	positions and dimensions (horizontal components are
	treated as 0).

	This is extremely useful for a correct labeling of objects.
	You would e.g. label a string gadget by using a text object
	with a phantom string frame. Thus, the label text will
	be always on the same vertical position as the string
	gadget text, no matter what spacing values the user
	configured.

    SEE ALSO
	Label() macros in "mui.h".
Area.mui/MUIA_FrameTitle

    NAME
	MUIA_FrameTitle -- (V4 ) [I..], STRPTR

    FUNCTION
	This tag identifies a text string that will be displayed
	centered in the top line of a frame. This can become
	handy if you want to name groups of objects.

	You may not use MUIA_FrameTitle without defining
	a MUIA_Frame.

    EXAMPLE
	VGroup,
	   MUIA_Frame     , MUIV_Frame_Group,
	   MUIA_FrameTitle, "Spacing",
	   ...

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Frame
Area.mui/MUIA_Height

    NAME
	MUIA_Height -- (V4 ) [..G], LONG

    FUNCTION
	You can use this to read the current position and
	dimension of an object, if you e.g. need it to pop
	up some requester below.

	Of course, this attribute is only valid when the
	parent window of the object is currently open.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_TopEdge, MUIA_Width, MUIA_LeftEdge,
	MUIA_RightEdge, MUIA_BottomEdge
Area.mui/MUIA_HorizDisappear

    NAME
	MUIA_HorizDisappear -- (V11) [ISG], LONG

    FUNCTION
	Objects with a disappear level disappear automatically
	when their parent window gets too small to display them.
	Use this for things that make your GUI look nicer
	(e.g. Imagery) but are not absolutely necessary.

	By using disappearing objects, you can make nice GUIs
	which still work on crappy 640x200 screens.

	You can give horizontal or vertical disappear levels
	to objects which are used for horizontal or vertical
	layout calculations respectively.

	Objects with a small disappear level disappear before
	objects with a big disappear level.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_VertDisappear
Area.mui/MUIA_HorizWeight

    NAME
	MUIA_HorizWeight -- (V4 ) [ISG], WORD

    FUNCTION
	Adjust the horizontal weight of an object. Usually
	you can simply use MUIA_Weight instead of this tag
	but in some two-dimensional groups it may become
	handy to have different horizontal and vertical 
	weights.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Weight
Area.mui/MUIA_InnerBottom

    NAME
	MUIA_InnerBottom -- (V4 ) [I.G], LONG

    FUNCTION
	Adjust the space between an object and its frame.
	Usually you shouldn't use this tag since you will
	override the users preferred default setting.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Frame
Area.mui/MUIA_InnerLeft

    NAME
	MUIA_InnerLeft -- (V4 ) [I.G], LONG

    FUNCTION

Area.mui/MUIA_InnerTop

    NAME
	MUIA_InnerTop -- (V4 ) [I.G], LONG

Area.mui/MUIA_InputMode

    NAME
	MUIA_InputMode -- (V4 ) [I..], LONG

    SPECIAL INPUTS
	MUIV_InputMode_None
	MUIV_InputMode_RelVerify
	MUIV_InputMode_Immediate
	MUIV_InputMode_Toggle

    FUNCTION
	Adjust the input mode for an object.

	MUI has no distinct button class. Instead you can make
	every object (even groups) behave like a button by
	setting an input mode for them. Several input modes
	area available:

	MUIV_InputMode_None:
	   No input, this is not a gadget.

	MUIV_InputMode_RelVerify:
	   For buttons and similar stuff.

	MUIV_InputMode_Immediate:
	   Used e.g. in a radio button object.

	MUIV_InputMode_Toggle:
	   For things like checkmark gadgets.

	The input mode setting determines how a user action
	will trigger the attributes MUIA_Selected, MUIA_Pressed
	and MUIA_Timer. See their documentation for details.

    EXAMPLE
	/* A traditional button, just a text object with */
	/* a button frame and a relverify input mode:    */

	okbutton = TextObject,
	   MUIA_Frame        , MUIV_Frame_Button,
	   MUIA_InputMode    , MUIV_InputMode_RelVerify,
	   MUIA_Text_Contents, "OK",

Area.mui/MUIA_Pressed

    NAME
	MUIA_Pressed -- (V4 ) [..G], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	Learn if a button is pressed (or released).
	The MUIA_Pressed attribute of a gadget is triggered
	by some user action, depending on the input mode:

	MUIV_InputMode_RelVerify:
	   - set when lmb is pressed.
	   - cleared when lmb is released and the mouse
	     is still over the gadget (otherwise it will
	     be cleared too, but without triggering a
	     notification event).

	MUIV_InputMode_Immediate:
	   - undefined, use MUIA_Selected for this.

	MUIV_InputMode_Toggle:
	   - undefined, use MUIA_Selected for this.

	Waiting for MUIA_Pressed getting FALSE is the usual
	way to react on button gadgets.

    EXAMPLE
	DoMethod(btcancel,MUIM_Notify,MUIA_Pressed,FALSE,
	   app,2,MUIM_Application_ReturnID,ID_CANCEL);

	clicking on the gadget (or using the keyboard),
	depending on the input mode:

	MUIV_InputMode_RelVerify:
	   - set when lmb is pressed.
	   - cleared when lmb is released.
	   - cleared when the gadget is selected and the
	     mouse leaves the gadget box.
	   - set when the mouse reenters the gadget box.

	MUIV_InputMode_Immediate:
	   - set when lmb is pressed.

	MUIV_InputMode_Toggle:
	   - toggled when lmb is pressed.

	Of course you may set this attribute yourself, e.g.
	to adjust the state of a checkmark gadget.

	A selected gadget will display its border reverse
	and get the configured MUII_SelectedBack background.
	This can be avoided using the MUIA_ShowSelState tag.

Area.mui/MUIA_ShortHelp

    NAME
	MUIA_ShortHelp -- (V11) [ISG], STRPTR

    FUNCTION
	Specify a string that is to be used as bubble help for this
	object.
Area.mui/MUIA_ShowMe

    NAME
	MUIA_ShowMe -- (V4 ) [ISG], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	Objects with this attribute set are not displayed. You can
	set MUIA_ShowMe at any time, causing objects to appear and
	to disappear immediately. A new layout is calculated whenever
	some objects are shown or hidden. When necessary, MUI will
	resize the parent window to make place for the new objects.

    NOTE
	Currently, MUI does a complete window refresh after
	showing/hiding objects. This behaviour might get improved
	in the future.
Area.mui/MUIA_ShowSelState

    NAME
	MUIA_ShowSelState -- (V4 ) [I..], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	Normally a gadget will reverse its frame and
	display the configured MUII_SelectetBack background
	pattern in its selected state. For some objects
	(e.g. checkmarks) this is not recommended and
	can be supressed by setting MUIA_ShowSelState
	to FALSE.

    SEE ALSO

Area.mui/MUIA_Timer

    NAME
	MUIA_Timer -- (V4 ) [..G], LONG

    FUNCTION
	MUIA_Timer gets triggered when a relverify button is 
	pressed and (after a little delay) increases every 
	INTUITICK as long as the mouse remains over the gadget.

	This makes it possible to have buttons repeatedly
	cause some actions, just like the arrow gadgets of
	a scrollbar.

    EXAMPLE
	DoMethod(btmore,MUIM_Notify,MUIA_Timer,MUIV_EveryTime,
	   app,2,MUIM_Application_ReturnID,ID_MORE);

	DoMethod(btless,MUIM_Notify,MUIA_Timer,MUIV_EveryTime,

	up some requester below.

	Of course, this attribute is only valid when the
	parent window of the object is currently open.

Area.mui/MUIA_VertDisappear

    NAME
	MUIA_VertDisappear -- (V11) [ISG], LONG

    FUNCTION
	Objects with a disappear level disappear automatically
	when their parent window gets too small to display them.
	Use this for things that make your GUI look nicer
	(e.g. Imagery) but are not absolutely necessary.

	By using disappearing objects, you can make nice GUIs
	which still work on crappy 640x200 screens.

	You can give horizontal or vertical disappear levels
	to objects which are used for horizontal or vertical
	layout calculations respectively.

	Objects with a small disappear level disappear before
	objects with a big disappear level.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_HorizDisappear
Area.mui/MUIA_VertWeight

    NAME
	MUIA_VertWeight -- (V4 ) [ISG], WORD

    FUNCTION
	Adjust the vertical weight of an object. Usually
	you can simply use MUIA_Weight instead of this tag
	but in some two-dimensional groups it may become
	handy to have different horizontal and vertical
	weights.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Weight
Area.mui/MUIA_Weight

    NAME
	MUIA_Weight -- (V4 ) [I..], WORD

    FUNCTION
	This tag is a shorthand for MUIA_HorizWeight and
	MUIA_VertWeight, it sets both weights at once.

	The weight of an object determines how much room it
	will get during the layout process. Imagine you have
	a 100 pixel wide horizontal group with two string
	gadgets. Usually, each gadget will get half of the
	room and be 50 pixels wide. If you feel the left
	gadget is more important and should be bigger,
	you can give it a weight of 200 (and 100 for
	the right gadget). Because the left gadget is
	twice as "heavy" as the right gadget, it will
	become twice as big (about 66 pixel) as the
	right one (34 pixel).

	Of course giving weights only makes sense if the
	object is resizable. A MUIA_VertWeight for a
	(always fixed height) string gadget is useless.

	An object with a weight of 0 will always stay
	at its minimum size.

	By default, all objects have a weight of 100.

    EXAMPLE
	HGroup,
	   StringGadget, MUIA_Weight,  50, End,
	   StringGadget, MUIA_Weight, 100, End,
	   StringGadget, MUIA_Weight, 200, End,

Area.mui/MUIM_ContextMenuBuild

    NAME
	MUIM_ContextMenuBuild (V11)

    SYNOPSIS
	DoMethod(obj,MUIM_ContextMenuBuild,LONG mx, LONG my);

    FUNCTION
	Allows dynamic creation of context menus.
	When MUI is about to show a new context menu, it does not
	simply use the MUIA_ContextMenu field of area class. Instead,
	it sends a MUIM_ContextMenuBuild to the object in question and
	uses the return value as the new menustrip object.

	When MUIM_ContextMenuBuild reaches area class, it just return
	the contents of MUIA_ContextMenu so you neednt care about this
	method if you only have static, non-changing context menus.

	However, if your context menus depend on some internal states
	of your objects or on the mouse position within your objects,
	you have to have a subclass which overrides
	MUIM_ContextMenuBuild, creates a nice menustrip object and
	returns it.

    INPUTS
	mx - current x position of mouse
	my - current y position of mouse

	Since MUI does (unfortunately) not use relative coordinates 
	at all, these two aren't relative either.

    RESULT
	You must return a pointer to a menustrip object or NULL if
	you failed to create one.

    NOTES
	MUI will never dispose the object you return. You must be
	take care of this yourself, e.g. by storing a pointer somewhere
	in your instance data and killing it on the next invocation
	of MUIM_ContextMenuBuild and on OM_DISPOSE.

	Even when overriding MUIM_ContextMenuBuild, you *must* set
	MUIA_ContextMenu of your object to something different from NULL.
	MUI will find out that your object actually has a popup menu
	by directly checking the contents of MUIA_ContextMenu in the
	instance data of area class due to speed reasons.

    NAME
	MUIM_CreateBubble (V18)

    SYNOPSIS
	DoMethod(obj,MUIM_CreateBubble,LONG x, LONG y, char *txt, ULONG flags);

    FUNCTION
	Together with MUIM_DeleteBubble, this method provides an
	interface for MUIs bubble mechanism. Applications can use
	bubbles for their own purpose, e.g. for indicating error
	conditions on certain gadgets.

	MUIM_CreateBubble creates a bubble at the specified
	coordinates with the specified (textual) contents. It
	returns a bubble "handle" that has to be passed to
	MUIM_DeleteBubble when the bubble shall disappear.

	There's no limitation on the number of bubbles, you can create
	lots of them at a time if you wish. Also, these custom bubbles
	are completely independant of MUI's bubble help system and won't
	disappear automatically when the mouse is moved.

	Note that bubbles will only show up when the object in question
	is visible. Otherwise MUIM_CreateBubble returns NULL. You are
	responsible for deleting the bubble *before* the object get's
	invisible. Good place to remove a custom bubble is e.g. the
	MUIM_Hide method of your object.

    INPUTS
	- x,y: window-relative coordinates of the bubble.

	- txt: custom text for the bubble. If you pass NULL here, MUI
	       will query the object with MUIM_CreateShortHelp method
	       for a text (like the automatic help system does).

	- flags: always set to 0 for now!

    RESULT
	This method returns a pointer to a (black box) bubble handle or
	NULL on failure. You have to pass the bubble handle to 
	MUIM_DeleteBubble if you want to delete the bubble later.

    NAME
	MUIM_DragQuery (V11)

    SYNOPSIS
	DoMethod(obj,MUIM_DragQuery,Object *obj);

    FUNCTION
	MUI offers complete drag & drop capabilities for every object.
	If enabled, the user is able to grab an object, drag it around
	and drop it on another object. Currently, D&D is limited to
	single applications, i.e. you cannot take an object from one
	program and drop it into another one. D&D between different
	windows of the same application, however, is fine.

	MUI controls the D&D actions with a set of five methods:
	MUIM_DragQuery, MUIM_DragBegin, MUIM_DragReport, MUIM_DragDrop
	and MUIM_DragFinish. Basically things work this way:

	Lets assume the user has taken an object (called the source
	object) and is now starting to drag it around. During
	dragging, MUI will find out which object is currently under
	the mouse pointer and if it found one, send it the
	MUIM_DragQuery method. An object that receives MUIM_DragQuery
	can now determine it it wishes to accept drops from the source
	object or not. If it responds positively, the object will
	become the current destination object.

	Due to the nature of MUIs layout system, a specific x,y pair
	of coordinates cannot be bound to a specific object
	immediately. Instead, the coordinates belong to a whole tree
	of objects, for example some cycle gadget, its parent group,
	the parent group of the parent group and so on until the tree
	reaches the windows root object. To allow complete groups of
	objects to participate in D&D business, the MUIM_DragQuery is
	first sent to the deepest nested object (the cycle gadget in
	the above example). If this one doesn't respond, MUI sends a
	MUIM_DragQuery to its parent group and so on until it either
	finds some object who accepts the drop or reaches the end of
	the tree. If there is an accepting object, it will become the
	current destination, if there isnt, no destination will be
	set.

	Objects becoming active destinations of a drag process learn
	about their current state by receiving a MUIM_DragBegin
	method. This method, when reaching area class, e.g. draws a
	special frame around the object to indicate the current state
	to the user.

	The opposite of MUIM_DragBegin is MUIM_DragFinish will be sent
	as soon as the object stops being destination of the drag
	process, i.e. because the user aborted the drag or moved out
	of the bounding box. MUIM_DragFinish will also be sent after a
	successful drop, you cant count on receiving a MUIM_DragFinish
	if you received a MUIM_DragBegin before. Furthermore, only one
	object will be between MUIM_DragBegin and MUIM_DragFinish at
	any time.

	Active destination objects (between MUIM_DragBegin and
	MUIM_DragFinish) receive MUIM_DragReport methods as long as
	the user moves the mouse within the object. MUIM_DragReport
	contains the mouse coordinates, so the object can update its
	display according to the position of the source object. A
	listview would e.g. indicate the insert position to give the
	user an idea where the source would be inserted in case of a
	drop.

	All the method mentioned above are just interim messages that
	help visualizing the drag process. When the user actually
	decides to drop its source object, the current destination
	object (if any) receives a MUIM_DragDrop method and can
	perfrom whatever operatoin it thinks is suited to handle a D&D
	action from the source object.

	You probably have noticed that D&D is controlled by methods.
	This means that you need to write subclasses if you intend to
	use it. However, you neednt implement all the above mentioned
	things to reach your goal. In fact, MUIM_DragQuery and
	MUIM_DragDrop are enough for almost all D&D invocations.
	Here's a little example of how MUI implements D&D between
	objects of Pendisplay class. These few lines allow the user to
	take any Pendisplay (or subclasses from Pendisplay like e.g.
	Poppen class) and drop it onto another one:

	ULONG mDragQuery(cl,obj,struct MUIP_DragQuery *msg)
	{
		char *spec;

		/* refuse to drop on ourselves */
		if (msg->obj==obj)
			return(MUIV_DragQuery_Refuse);

		/* if the source object offers the attribute */
		/* we want, show that we would accept it. */
		if (get(msg->obj,MUIA_Pendisplay_Spec,&spec))
			return(MUIV_DragQuery_Accept);

		/* refuse otherwise */
		return(MUIV_DragQuery_Refuse);
	}


	ULONG mDragDrop(cl,obj,struct MUIP_DragDrop *msg)
	{
		char *spec;

		/* copy the attribute from the source object */
		get(msg->obj,MUIA_Pendisplay_Spec,&spec);
		set(obj,MUIA_Pendisplay_Spec,spec);

		return(0);
	}
