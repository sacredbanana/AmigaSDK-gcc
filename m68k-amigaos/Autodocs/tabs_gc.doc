    NAME
       tabs.gadget--File folder tabs gadget.                   (V42)

    SUPERCLASS
	gadgetclass

    DESCRIPTION
	The tabs gadget class provides a custom control that has imagry
	similar in style to the tabs seen in a drawer full of file folders.
	The action of the gadget is the same as a conventional
	mutual-exclusion control in that only one tab can be active at a time
	and a tab is selected by clicking upon it.

	The purpose of the tabs gadget class is to provide functionality like
	the page selection cycle gadget on the top-right side of the AmigaOS
	2.1 PrinterPS preferences editor, but allowing all the choices to be
	visible at the same time.

	This gadget class requires 2.04 (V37) or greater.

    METHODS
	OM_NEW--Create the button gadget.  Passed to superclass, then OM_SET.

	OM_GET--Get an object attribute.  Passed to superclass for unknown
	    attributes.

	OM_SET--Set object attributes.  Passed to superclass first.

	OM_UPDATE--Set object notification attributes.  Passed to superclass
	    first.

	GM_LAYOUT--Calculate gadget imagry positioning.  Passed to superclass
	    first.

	GM_RENDER--Renders the gadget imagry.  Overrides the superclass.

	GM_HITTEST--Determines if mouse is within the gadget rectangle.  Over-
	    rides the superclass.

	GM_GOACTIVE--Handles activation, toggle-select and button-select.
	    Overrides the superclass.

	GM_GOINACTIVE--Deselects the button.  Overrides the superclass.

	All other methods are passed to the superclass, including OM_DISPOSE.

    ATTRIBUTES
	GA_Disabled (BOOL) -- Determines whether the button is disabled or
	    not.  Changing disable state will invoke GM_RENDER.  A disabled
	    button's border and label are all rendered in SHADOWPEN and then
	    dusted in a ghosting pattern that is rendered in SHADOWPEN.
	    Defaults to FALSE.

	GA_TextAttr (struct TextAttr *) -- Text attribute for the font to
	    use for the labels.

	LAYOUTA_ChildMaxWidth (BOOL) -- Indicate whether the tabs should be
	    the width of the widest label.  Defaults to TRUE.

	TABS_Labels (TabLabelP) -- An array of TabLabel structures used to
	    indicate the labels for each of the tabs.

	TABS_Current (LONG) -- Currently selected tab.  Defaults to zero.

    NOTES
	This gadget class requires 2.04 or beyond to run.
