	A Scale object generates a percentage scale
	running from 0% to 100%. A good place for
	such an object is e.g. below a fuel gauge.

	Depending on how much space is available,
	the scale will be more or less detailed.

	Due to MUI's automatic layout system, you
	don't need to worry about it's size. When
	placed in a vertical group just below the
	object you want to scale, everything is
	fine.
