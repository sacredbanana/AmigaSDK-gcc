	Poppen class adds input capabilities to its super class
	Pendisplay. It should be used if your application allows 
	users to configure some custom pens for rendering.

	A Poppen object will appear as kind of a button which 
	displays the currently selected color. When the user hits 
	the button, a Popup window containing a Penadjust object 
	opens up and lets the user choose change the color.

	You can control the window title of the popup window using 
	the MUIA_Window_Title on the Poppen object. It will remember 
	its value and use it when creating the popup window.

	As most MUI popups, the Penadjust popup window runs 
	asynchronously and stays there until the user terminates 
	it with "OK" or "Cancel". Furthermore, if the popup window 
	is automatically cancelled if the pop button receives a 
	MUIM_Cleanup method.

	Anyway, you dont have to care about the internals of this class.
	Just create it like

	obj = MUI_NewObject(MUIC_Poppen,
		MUIA_CycleChain  , 1,
		MUIA_Window_Title, "Followed Links Color",
		TAG_DONE);

	somewhere in your prefs window and everything will be fine. You
	can get/set the current color from a Poppen object by using
	the MUIA_Pendisplay_Spec attribute. The resulting struct
	MUI_SpenSpec may then be saved somewhere in your preferences
	and used as parameter for MUI_ObtainPen() and MUI_ReleasePen().

	You can find some example code on using this class in the
	Class2 demo of the MUI distribution.
