    NAME
	getcolor.gadget -- Create getcolor BOOPSI objects

    SUPERCLASS
	gadgetclass

    REQUIRES
	window.class, button.gadget, layout.gadget, slider.gadget,
	colorwheel.gadget, gradientslider.gadget, space.gadget,
	radiobutton.gadget, bevel.image, label.image

    DESCRIPTION
	The getcolor gadget class is used to define and select colors from a
	standard color requester in an easy and consistent way. It consists
	of a button gadget that is used to open the color requester and show
	the result (the currently selected color).

    PROGRAMMING STYLE
	This class provides several attributes allowing to override the
	user's global choices for the color requester contents and layout.
	However, it is not recommended to do so without a good reason.

	Good reasons may include the necessity of keeping the requester
	size as small as possible, or other special requirements of your
	application which make it necessary to filter out some of the
	possible options. If you really need to do this, try to offer the
	user the ability to switch off such limitations.

	For normal applications, no attributes should ever be set other
	than GETCOLOR_TitleText, GETCOLOR_Screen and those affecting the
	current color value such as GETCOLOR_Color or the various 32-bit
	variants thereof.

	   If TRUE, the user will be able to switch between RGB

	   from user preferences or to the normal gadget font if
	   no "fallback font" is defined.

	   Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET)

getcolor.gadget/GCOLOR_REQUEST                 getcolor.gadget/GCOLOR_REQUEST

    NAME
	GCOLOR_REQUEST -- Invokes the color requester.

    SYNOPSIS
	result = DoMethodA(obj, msg);
	D0

	ULONG DoMethodA(Object *, struct gcRequest *);

    FUNCTION
	Opens the color requester and blocks the given window. When the
	user has finished making adjustments the selection details are
	sent via the OM_NOTIFY mechanism. All the attributes marked with
	OM_NOTIFY are sent to the receiver.

    INPUTS
	obj - getcolor object pointer
	msg - pointer to fully initialized struct gcRequest
	      (see <gadgets/getcolor.h>)

    RESULT
	Returns non-zero if successful or 0 on error.

getcolor.gadget/GETCOLOR_GetClass           getcolor.gadget/GETCOLOR_GetClass

    NAME
	GETCOLOR_GetClass -- Gets the pointer to the color requester class.

    SYNOPSIS
	getcolor_class = GETCOLOR_GetClass();
	D0

	Class * GETCOLOR_GetClass(VOID);

    FUNCTION
	Obtains the pointer to the getcolor gadget class for use with
	NewObject().  This function always returns a valid pointer so
	you do not need to check it.  The reason is that if the library
	opens fine, then the pointer returned is already set up.
	(Of course this implies that if opening the library fails, you
	shouldn't be calling this.)

	Note that this function does not create the class, that is done
	when the class library is opened.

    INPUTS
	Nothing.

    RESULT
	getcolor_class - Pointer to the getcolor gadget class.
