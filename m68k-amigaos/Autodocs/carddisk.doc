carddisk.device/TD_ADDCHANGEINT               carddisk.device/TD_ADDCHANGEINT

   NAME
	TD_ADDCHANGEINT -- add a disk change software interrupt handler.

   FUNCTION
	This command lets you add a software interrupt handler to the
	disk device that gets invoked whenever a disk insertion or removal
	occurs.

	You must pass in a properly initialized Exec Interrupt structure
	and be prepared to deal with disk insertions/removals
	immediately. From within the interrupt handler, you may only call the
	status commands that can use IOF_QUICK.

	To set up the handler, an Interrupt structure must be initialized.
	This structure is supplied as the io_Data to the TD_ADDCHANGEINT
	command. The handler then gets linked into the handler chain and
	gets invoked whenever a disk change happens. You must eventually
	remove the handler before you exit.

	This command only returns when the handler is removed. That is,
	the device holds onto the IO request until the TD_REMCHANGEINT command
	is executed with that same IO request. Hence, you must use SendIO()
	with this command.

   IO REQUEST INPUT
	io_Device	preset by the call to OpenDevice()
	io_Unit		preset by the call to OpenDevice()
	io_Command	TD_ADDCHANGEINT
	io_Flags	0
	io_Length	sizeof(struct Interrupt)
	io_Data		pointer to Interrupt structure

   IO REQUEST RESULT
	io_Error - 0 for success, or an error code as defined in
	           <devices/trackdisk.h>

   NAME
	TD_CHANGENUM -- return the current value of the card-change counter.

   FUNCTION
	This command returns the current value of the card-change counter (as
	used by the enhanced commands). The change counter is incremented
	each time a card is inserted or removed from the unit.

   IO REQUEST INPUT
	io_Device	preset by the call to OpenDevice()
	io_Unit		preset by the call to OpenDevice()
	io_Command	TD_CHANGENUM
	io_Flags	0 or IOF_QUICK

   IO REQUEST RESULT
	io_Error - 0 for success, or an error code as defined in
	           <devices/trackdisk.h>
	io_Actual - if io_Error is 0, this contains the current value of the
		    disk-change counter.

carddisk.device/TD_CHANGESTATE                 carddisk.device/TD_CHANGESTATE

   NAME
	TD_CHANGESTATE -- check if a card is currently inserted.

   FUNCTION
	This command checks to see if there is currently a card inserted.

   IO REQUEST INPUT
	io_Device	preset by the call to OpenDevice()
	io_Unit		preset by the call to OpenDevice()
	io_Command	TD_CHANGESTATE
	io_Flags	0 or IOF_QUICK

   IO REQUEST RESULT
	io_Error - 0 for success, or an error code as defined in
	           <devices/trackdisk.h>
	io_Actual - if io_Error is 0, this tells you whether a card is
		    inserted. 0 means there is a card, while anything else
		    indicates there is none.

carddisk.device/TD_FORMAT                           carddisk.device/TD_FORMAT

   NAME
	TD_FORMAT/ETD_FORMAT -- Write data to card memory

   FUNCTION
	This function is traditionally used to write data to a disk
	that has not yet been formatted before or has had a hard error
	on a standard write command. None of these states apply to the
	credit card device, and as such, this command is identical to
	CMD_WRITE.

   IO REQUEST INPUT
	io_Device	preset by the call to OpenDevice()
	io_Unit		preset by the call to OpenDevice()
	io_Command	TD_FORMAT or ETD_FORMAT
	io_Flags	0 or IOF_QUICK
	io_Data		points to a buffer containing the data to write to the
			track, must be at least as large as io_Length.
	io_Length	number of bytes to write, must be a multiple of the
			card block size.
	io_Offset	byte offset from the start of the card, must be a
			multiple of the card block size.
	iotd_Count	(ETD_FORMAT only) maximum allowable change counter
			value.

       TD_GETGEOMETRY -- return the geometry of the credit card.

   FUNCTION
	This command returns a full set of information about the
	layout of the drive. The information is returned in the
	DriveGeometry structure pointed to by io_Data.

   IO REQUEST INPUT
	io_Device	preset by the call to OpenDevice()
	io_Unit		preset by the call to OpenDevice()
	io_Command	TD_GETGEOMETRY
	io_Flags	0 or IOF_QUICK

   NAME
	TD_MOTOR/ETD_MOTOR -- control the on/off state of the card LED.

   FUNCTION
	This command gives control over the card LED. The LED may be
	turned on or off.

	In addition, the standard instructions to the user are that it is safe
	to remove a card if and only if the LED is off.

   IO REQUEST INPUT
	io_Device	preset by the call to OpenDevice()
	io_Unit		preset by the call to OpenDevice()
	io_Command	TD_MOTOR or ETD_MOTOR
	io_Flags	0 or IOF_QUICK
	io_Length	the requested state of the LED, 0 to turn the LED
			off, and 1 to turn the LED on.
	iotd_Count	(ETD_MOTOR only) maximum allowable change counter
			value.

   IO REQUEST RESULT
	io_Error - 0 for success, or an error code as defined in
	           <devices/trackdisk.h>
	io_Actual - if io_Error is 0 this contains the previous state of the
		    LED.

carddisk.device/TD_PROTSTATUS                   carddisk.device/TD_PROTSTATUS

   NAME
	TD_PROTSTATUS -- return whether the card is write-protected.

   FUNCTION
	This command is used to determine whether the current card is
	write-protected.

   IO REQUEST INPUT
	io_Device	preset by the call to OpenDevice()
	io_Unit		preset by the call to OpenDevice()
	io_Command	TD_PROTSTATUS
	io_Flags	0 or IOF_QUICK

   IO REQUEST RESULT
	io_Error - 0 for success, or an error code as defined in
	           <devices/trackdisk.h>
	io_Actual - if io_Error is 0, this tells you whether the card
		    is write-protected. 0 means the card is NOT write-
		    protected, while any other value indicates it is.

carddisk.device/TD_RAWREAD                         carddisk.device/TD_RAWREAD

   NAME
	TD_RAWREAD/ETD_RAWREAD -- read raw data from the card.

   FUNCTION
	Raw read data bytes - typical use is to read bytes from
	CIS for verification during writes.  Bytes read from attribute
	memory can be done as multi-byte reads returning junk for
	odd byte addresses, though single byte reads from even byte
	addresses is recommended.

	The caller MUST own the the card, and must pass in a valid
	pointer to the credit-card common memory, or attribute memory.
	the raw read function fails if the device owns the card.


	
   IO REQUEST INPUT
	io_Device	preset by the call to OpenDevice()
	io_Unit		preset by the call to OpenDevice()
	io_Command      TD_RAWREAD or ETD_RAWREAD.
	io_Flags	ignored.
	io_Length	Length of buffer in bytes, with a maximum of 65535
			bytes.
	io_Data		Pointer to buffer where data is to be deposited.
	io_Offset	Address in the credit card or attribute memory.


   IO REQUEST RESULT
	io_Error - 0 for success, or an error code as defined in
	           <devices/trackdisk.h>

   NOTES
	Note that the use of the carddisk.device RAWREAD function makes
	it possible to use other deices if needed in the future which
	support RAWREAD commands like thse to read a new CIS from flash
	ROMs, SRAM cards with EEPROMs from attribute memory. Some
	vendors have attribute memory options for their SRAM cards. Of
	interest, these can actually be formatted as disks even if there
	is no writeable attribute memory. There is code for these cases:

	1) A formatted card which lacks a device tuple as the first
	tuple in attribute memory.  This works if there is a LINKTARGET
	tuple starting at mem location 0 in common memory, and the
	CISTPL_FORMAT tuple is stored in common memory.

	2) Like #1, but there is a CISTPL_DEVICE tuple in common memory.
	This is technically not allowed, though supported by the device in
	anticipation of using SRAM cards which lack attribute memory.

	3) The attribute memory, and common memory overlap, and the
	CIS has been properly written such that the CIS is stored in
	even bytes only until a LONGLINK_C tuple is found which continues
	the chain in contiguous bytes in common memory.  POQET SRAM cards
	have such overlapped memory, as do Intel Flash-ROMS.

   NAME
	TD_RAWWRITE/ETD_RAWWRITE -- write raw data to the card.

   FUNCTION
	Raw write data bytes - most likely use is to write CIS bytes to card.
	Bytes written to attribute memory can be done as multi-byte writes
	with junk for odd bytes, though single byte writes to even byte
	addresses is recommended.

	Caller MUST own the card!

   IO REQUEST RESULT
	io_Error - 0 for success, or an error code as defined in

   NOTES
	Caller MUST own card, and pass in a valid pointer to
	credit-card common memory, or attribute memory.  The raw r/w
	commands fail if the device owns the card.  This has been done
	to prevent problems with someone who thinks they know how to
	deal with trackdisk, but provides an option to use another
	device!  Rather than crashing because these commands are being
	used improperly, we return that these commands are not supported.
	Of course if they call these functions without checking for
	disk status change status, oh well...
