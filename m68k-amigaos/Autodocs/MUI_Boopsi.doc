	MUI's boopsi class provides an interface to standard,
	system style boopsi gadgets. Since boopsis gadgetclass
	misses some important features needed for an automatic
	layout system like MUI, there are several problems with
	such an interface. MUI tries to solve these problems
	with some additional attributes.

	Coming with release 3.x of the amiga operating system are
	some very nice boopsi gadgets such as "colorwheel.gadget"
	or "gradientslider.gadget". With MUI's boopsi class, you
	can use these gadgets just as if they were MUI objects.

	You can talk to a MUIized boopsi object as if it was the
	boopsi object itself. MUI will pass through all attributes
	and try to be completely transparent. Additionally, if
	a boopsi object generates notification events via
	IDCMP_UPDATE, MUI turns them into MUI notification events.
	Thus, you can e.g. react on the change of WHEEL_Saturation
	in a MUI colorwheel boopsi gadget as on any other MUI
	attribute.

	An example program "BoopsiDoor.c" is provided to show
	how this magic works.

   Note: OS 3.0/3.1 colorwheel.gadget can accidently render itself
         one pixel too big, overwriting other parts of the window.
         As a workaround, MUI will subtract one from the width/height
         before passing it on to a colorwheel boopsi object.
Boopsi.mui/MUIA_Boopsi_Class

    NAME
	MUIA_Boopsi_Class -- (V4 ) [ISG], struct IClass *

    FUNCTION
	Pointer to the (private) class you want to create a boopsi
	object from. Only useful if you previously generated your
	own boopsi class with MakeClass().

	Of course you may not free the class until you're done
	with your object.

    NAME
	MUIA_Boopsi_ClassID -- (V4 ) [ISG], char *

    FUNCTION
	MUIA_Boopsi_ClassID specifies the name for the public
	Boopsi class you want to create an object of. It will
	only be used when MUIA_Boopsi_Class is NULL.

	The public class must be in memory before you can create
	an instance of it, you will have to open the required class
	library by hand.

	Note the string given to MUIA_Boopsi_ClassID must remain
	valid until you're done with the object.

    EXAMPLE

	/* Complete example code can be found in BoopsiDoor.c */

	cwbase = OpenLibrary("gadgets/colorwheel.gadget",0);

	Wheel = BoopsiObject,  /* MUI and Boopsi tags mixed */
	 NeXTFrame,
	 MUIA_Boopsi_ClassID  , "colorwheel.gadget",
	 MUIA_Boopsi_MinWidth , 30, /* boopsi objects don't know */
	 MUIA_Boopsi_MinHeight, 30, /* their sizes, so we help   */
 	 MUIA_Boopsi_Remember , WHEEL_Saturation, /* keep important values */
	 MUIA_Boopsi_Remember , WHEEL_Hue,        /* during window resize  */
	 MUIA_Boopsi_TagScreen, WHEEL_Screen, /* this magic fills in */

    NAME
	MUIA_Boopsi_MaxHeight -- (V4 ) [ISG], ULONG

    FUNCTION
	For MUI's automatic layout system, it's required that
	objects know their minimum and maximums sizes. Since boopsi 
	gadgets don't support this feature, you will have to help
	MUI and adjust these values by hand.

	Defaults:

	   MUIA_Boopsi_MinWidth  - 1 pixel
	   MUIA_Boopsi_MinHeight - 1 pixel
	   MUIA_Boopsi_MaxWidth  - unlimited
	   MUIA_Boopsi_MaxHeight - unlimited

Boopsi.mui/MUIA_Boopsi_Object

    NAME
	MUIA_Boopsi_Object -- (V4 ) [..G], Object *

    FUNCTION
	No input, just an output since this attribute is
	only getable. What MUI returns when generating a
	BoopsiObject is a standard MUI object, not a pointer
	to the Boopsi gadget itself. In case you really need
	this Boopsi gadget pointer, you can obtain it by getting
	MUIA_Boopsi_Object from the MUI object.

	Since MUI passes along every unknown attribute to the 
	boopsi gadget, there should be no need for this tag anyway.

	Note that the boopsi object pointer is only valid when the
	window is open!

Boopsi.mui/MUIA_Boopsi_Remember

    NAME
	MUIA_Boopsi_Remember -- (V4 ) [I..], ULONG

    FUNCTION
	Most boopsi objects are kind of silly, they don't support
	automatic resizing or jumping from screen to screen.
	Therefor, MUI sometimes needs to dispose and regenerate
	a boopsi object. This will result in loosing the current
	state of the object, e.g. saturation and hue values
	in a colorwheel.

	To solve this problem, you can tell MUI what attributes
	must be remembered during dispose/regeneration. For a
	colorwheel, this would e.g. be WHEEL_Saturation and WHEEL_Hue.

	Before disposing the boopsi object, the remember tags are
	read and stored in a private buffer. After regeneration,
	the contents of this buffer are passed back to the boopsi
	again.

	Note that you can define up to five MUIA_Boopsi_Remember tags.

    BUGS
	The remember procedure will not work when the attributes
	you want to remember are just pointers to data stored
	somewhere in the boopsi object.

Boopsi.mui/MUIA_Boopsi_Smart

    NAME
	MUIA_Boopsi_Smart -- (V9 ) [I..], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	Specify TRUE for smart BOOPSI gadgets that allow resizing,
	e.g. the textfield.class. In this case, MUI will not
	dispose and recreate the object.
Boopsi.mui/MUIA_Boopsi_TagDrawInfo

    NAME
	MUIA_Boopsi_TagDrawInfo -- (V4 ) [ISG], ULONG

    FUNCTION
	Unfortunately, most boopsi gadgets need information on
	the display environment they will reside in at object
	creation time. Due to MUI's concept, this information
	is not available that early.

	To solve this problem, MUI doesn't generate the boopsi
	object instantly, creation is delayed until the window
	containing the gadget is opened.

	At this time, MUI fills some values about display
	environment into the boopsi objects creation tag list.
	You have to tell MUI, what tags are actually needed.

	With MUIA_Boopsi_TagDrawInfo you can tell MUI where
	to fill in a needed DrawInfo structure.

    EXAMPLE
	If your boopsi gadget needs a pointer to a DrawInfo
	structure supplied with the MYBOOPSI_DrawInfo tag,
	you would have to specify

	BoopsiObject,
	   RecessedFrame,
	   ...
	   MUIA_Boopsi_TagDrawInfo, MYBOOPSI_DrawInfo,
	   ...
	   MYBOOPSI_DrawInfo, 0, /* will be filled later by MUI */
	   ...
	   GA_Left  , 0, /* needs to be there, will */
	   GA_Top   , 0, /* be filled later by MUI  */
	   GA_Width , 0,
	   GA_Height, 0,

	   End;

    NAME
	MUIA_Boopsi_TagScreen -- (V4 ) [ISG], ULONG

    FUNCTION
	Unfortunately, most boopsi gadgets need information on
	the display environment they will reside in at object
	creation time. Due to MUI's concept, this information
	is not available that early.

	To solve this problem, MUI doesn't generate the boopsi
	object instantly, creation is delayed until the window
	containing the gadget is opened.

	At this time, MUI fills some values about display
	environment into the boopsi objects creation tag list.
	You have to tell MUI, what tags are actually needed.

	With MUIA_Boopsi_TagScreen you can tell MUI where
	to fill in a needed Screen structure.

    EXAMPLE
	If your boopsi gadget needs a pointer to a Screen
	structure supplied with the MYBOOPSI_Screen tag,
	you would have to specify

	BoopsiObject,
	   RecessedFrame,
	   ...
	   MUIA_Boopsi_TagScreen, MYBOOPSI_Screen,
	   ...
	   MYBOOPSI_Screen, 0, /* will be filled later by MUI */
	   ...
	   GA_Left  , 0, /* needs to be there, will */
	   GA_Top   , 0, /* be filled later by MUI  */
	   GA_Width , 0,
	   GA_Height, 0,

	With MUIA_Boopsi_TagWindow you can tell MUI where
	to fill in a needed Window structure.

    EXAMPLE
	If your boopsi gadget needs a pointer to a Window
	structure supplied with the MYBOOPSI_Window tag,
	you would have to specify

	BoopsiObject,
	   RecessedFrame,
	   ...
	   MUIA_Boopsi_TagWindow, MYBOOPSI_Window,
	   ...
	   MYBOOPSI_Window, 0, /* will be filled later by MUI */
