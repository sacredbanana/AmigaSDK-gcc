	Text class allows generating objects that contain
	some kind of text. You can control the outfit of
	your text with some special control characters,
	including italics, bold, underline and color
	codes. Format codes align text either left,
	centered or right, linefeeds allow multiline
	text fields.
Text.mui/MUIA_Text_Contents

    NAME
	MUIA_Text_Contents -- (V4 ) [ISG], STRPTR

    FUNCTION
	String to be displayed in a text object.

	If the string is larger than available display space,
	it will be clipped. Setting MUIA_Text_Contents to NULL
	results in an empty text object.

	The string is copied into a private buffer, you can destroy
	the original after using this tag.

	Whenever MUI prints strings, they may contain some special
	character sequences defining format, color and style of the text.

	'\n'	 Start a new line. With this character you can e.g. create
		 multi line buttons.

	ESC -    Disable text engine, following chars will be printed
	         without further parsing.

	ESC u    Set the soft style to underline.

	ESC b    Set the soft style to bold.

	ESC i    Set the soft style to italic.

	ESC n    Set the soft style back to normal.

	ESC <n>  Use pen number n (2..9) as front pen. n must be a valid
		 DrawInfo pen as specified in "intuition/screens.h".

	ESC c    Center current (and following) line(s).
		 This sequence is only valid at the beginning of a
		 string or after a newline character.

	ESC r    Right justify current (and following) line(s).
		 This sequence is only valid at the beginning of a
		 string or after a newline character.

	ESC l    Left justify current (and following) line(s).
		 This sequence is only valid at the beginning of a
		 string or after a newline character.

	ESC I[s] Draw MUI image with specification <s>. See autodocs
	         of image class for image spec definition.

	Note:	 These rules apply to all MUI strings, not only to
		 a text objects contents. You can e.g. format the
	         columns of a listview or include images in a cycle
	         gadgets entries.

    EXAMPLE
	...
	MUIA_Text_Contents, "\33c\33bMUI\33n\nis magic"
	...

	would look like     |    MUI   |  <-- bold
	                    | is magic |  <-- normal

Text.mui/MUIA_Text_HiChar

    NAME
	MUIA_Text_HiChar -- (V4 ) [I..], char

    FUNCTION
	If the character given here exists in the displayed
	string (no matter if upper or lower case), it will
	be underlined. This makes it easy to create macros
	such as KeyButton() that specify the control char
	and the underline char at the same time.

Text.mui/MUIA_Text_PreParse

    NAME
	MUIA_Text_PreParse -- (V4 ) [ISG], STRPTR

    FUNCTION
	String containing format definitions to be parsed before
	the text from MUIA_Text_Contents is printed.

	Using this tag, you can easily define different formats,
	colors and styles without modifying the original string.

    EXAMPLE
	...
	MUIA_Text_PreParse, "\33c\33i",   // centered and italics
	MUIA_Text_Contents, "foobar",
	...

    SEE_ALSO
	MUIA_Text_Contents
Text.mui/MUIA_Text_SetMax

    NAME
	MUIA_Text_SetMax -- (V4 ) [I..], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	Boolean value to indicate wether the objects maximal width
	shall be calculated to fit the string given with
	MUIA_Text_Contents.

	When set to FALSE, maximum width is not limited.

	For a text object that needs to be updated (e.g. some
	information about your programs status) you would probably
	set MUIA_Text_SetMax to FALSE to allow resizing of this
	object.

	For a label for one of your gadgets, you might want to
	give this tag a value of TRUE to prevent MUI from
	inserting additional layout space.

	Defaults to FALSE.

    EXAMPLE
	...
	TX_Status = TextObject,
	   RecessedFrame,
	   MUIA_Background   , MUII_BACKGROUND,
	   MUIA_Text_PreParse, "\33c",
	   MUIA_Text_Contents, "running...",
	   End,
	...
	set(TX_Status,MUIA_Text_Contents,"reading...");
	...
	set(TX_Status,MUIA_Text_Contents,"writing...");
	...

Text.mui/MUIA_Text_SetMin

    NAME
	MUIA_Text_SetMin -- (V4 ) [I..], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	Boolean value to indicate wether the objects minimal width
	shall be calculated to fit the string given with
	MUIA_Text_Contents.

	When set to FALSE, minimum width will be set to 0
	and the displayed string may be clipped.

	Defaults to TRUE.

	MUIA_Text_SetMax, MUIA_Text_Contents
Text.mui/MUIA_Text_SetVMax

    NAME
	MUIA_Text_SetVMax -- (V11) [I..], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	Settings this to FALSE makes a TextObjects y-size unlimited.
	Defaults to TRUE which means the objects height is fixed.
