	Menustrip class is the base class for MUI's object oriented
	menus. Its children are objects of Menu class, each of
	them describes exactly one menu.

	A Menustrip object doesn't feature many options itself, but
	as a subclass of Family class, it simply acts as father for
	multiple Menu objects.

	The Menustrip object is usually specified as a child of
	either Application class or window class with the
	attributes MUIA_Application_Menustrip or
	MUIA_Window_Menustrip.
