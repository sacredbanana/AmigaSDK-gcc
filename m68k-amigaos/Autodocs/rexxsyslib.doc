    NAME
	ClearRexxMsg - Releases and clears the argument array in a RexxMsg

    SYNOPSIS
	ClearRexxMsg(msgptr, count)
	             A0      D0

	VOID ClearRexxMsg(struct RexxMsg *,ULONG)

    FUNCTION
	This function will DeleteArgstring() one or more argstrings from
	the RexxMsg and clear the slot.  The count is used to select the
	number of slots to clear.

    INPUTS
	msgptr - A pointer to a RexxMsg
	count - The number of slots to be cleared.  The number can be from
	        1 to 16.  (There are 16 slots)

    RESULTS
	All of the slots in the given count will be cleared and the argstring
	will have been released.

    NAME
	CreateArgstring - Create an argument string structure

    SYNOPSIS
	argstr = CreateArgstring(string, length)
	D0,A0                    A0      D0

	UBYTE *CreateArgstring(UBYTE *, ULONG);

    FUNCTION
	Allocates a RexxArg structure and copies the supplied string into it.
	The returned pointer points at the string part of the structure
	and can be treated like an ordinary string pointer.  (However, care
	must be taken that you do not change the string)

    INPUTS
	string - A pointer at your input string
	length - The number of bytes of your input string you wish copied.
	         (NOTE:  You are limited to 65,535 byte strings)

    RESULTS
	argstr - A pointer to the argument string.  The results are returned
	         in both A0 and D0.  You should always check the result
	         as an allocation failure would cause an error.

    NAME
	CreateRexxHostPort - Create a port for an ARexx host (V45)

    SYNOPSIS
	port = CreateRexxHostPort(basename)
	                            A0

	struct MsgPort *CreateRexxHostPort(const UBYTE *)

    FUNCTION
	Creates a unique port for an ARexx host.

    INPUTS
	basename - Name basis for the port. The final name of the port is
	           created by appending a period to the name, followed by
	           a number to make the port name unique.

    RESULTS
	result - a pointer to the port created, or NULL for failure

    NOTES
	All resources required for the port, including memory and the
	signal bit are allocated by this function. To release the port
	and all associated resources, use DeleteRexxHostPort().

    NAME
	CreateRexxMsg - Create an ARexx message structure

    SYNOPSIS
	rexxmsg = CreateRexxMsg(port, extension, host)
	D0,A0                   A0    A1         A2

	struct RexxMsg *CreateRexxMsg(struct MsgPort *, UBYTE *, UBYTE *)

    FUNCTION
	This functions allocates an ARexx message packet.  The RexxMsg
	consists of a standard EXEC message structure extended to include
	the ARexx specific information.

    INPUTS
	port - A pointer to a public or private message port.  This *MUST*
	       be a valid port as this is where the message will be replied.

	extension - A pointer to a NULL terminated string that is to be used
	            as the default extension for the REXX scripts.  If this
	            is NULL, the default is "REXX"

	host - A pointer to a NULL terminated string that is to be used
	       as the default host port.  The name must be the same as the
	       name of the public message port that is to be the default host.
	       If this field is NULL, the default is REXX.

    RESULTS
	rexxmsg - A RexxMsg structure

    NOTES
	The extension and host strings must remain valid for as long as the
	RexxMsg exists as only the pointer to those strings are stored.

    FUNCTION

    SYNOPSIS
	DeleteRexxMsg(packet)
	              A0

	VOID DeleteRexxMsg(struct RexxMsg *)

    FUNCTION
	The function releases an ARexx message packet that was allocated
	with CreateRexxMsg().  Any argument fields in the RexxMsg structure
	should be cleared before calling this function as it does
	not release them for you.

    INPUTS

    NAME
	FillRexxMsg - Fill the argument strings as needed

    SYNOPSIS
	result = FillRexxMsg(msgptr, count, mask)
	D0                   A0      D0     D1 [0:15]

	BOOL FillRexxMsg(struct RexxMsg *,ULONG,ULONG)

    FUNCTION
	This function will convert and install up to 16 argument strings into
	a RexxMsg structure.  The message packet's argument fields must be
	set to either a pointer to a NULL terminated string or an integer value
	The mask, bits 0 to 15, correspond to the type of value is stored
	in the argument slot.  If the bit is cleared, the argument is a
	string pointer; if the bit is set, the argument is an integer.

    INPUTS
	msgptr - Pointer to a RexxMsg (allocated via CreateRexxMsg)
	count - The number of argument slots to fill in.  This number should
	        be from 1 to 16.

	mask - A bit mask corresponding to the 16 fields that is used to
	       determine the type of the field.

    RESULTS
	result - A boolean.  If it is TRUE, the call worked.  If it is false,
	         some allocation did not work.  All argstrings that were
	         created will be released.

    SYNOPSIS
	FreeRexxMsg(rexxmsg);
	              A0

	void FreeRexxMsg(struct RexxMsg *);

    FUNCTION
	This function disposes a rexx message and its arguments formally
	created by LaunchRexxMsg(). It does not shut down the rm_Stdin and
	rm_Stdout streams of this message, nor does it check for the result
	codes. It disposes all the rexx arguments, though.

    INPUTS
	rexxmsg - a struct RexxMsg that has been created by LaunchRexxMsg()
	before. Should not be used for other messages.

    RESULTS

    NOTES
	Do not call this function on a message that did not yet return
	on your reply port or REXX may crash.

    FUNCTION
	Retrieves the value of an ARexx variable whose name is given as
	first argument, and places its length into the output buffer of
	the given size.

    INPUTS
	var    -   Name of the variable to be read. A stem variable is fine.
	msg    -   Pointer to a rexx message received by this program defining
	           the execution environment from which the variable is read.
	out    -   buffer to hold the value of the variable.

    NOTES

    SEE ALSO
	GetRexxVarFromMsg(), SetRexxVarFromMsg(),

    INPUTS
	var    -   Name of the variable to be read. A stem variable is fine.
	msg    -   Pointer to a rexx message received by this program defining
	           the execution environment from which the variable is read.
	out    -   buffer of 256 characters to hold the value of the variable.

    NOTES

    SEE ALSO
	GetRexxBufferFromMsg(), SetRexxVarFromMsg(),
	GetRexxVar() in amiga.lib

    BUGS
	This function always assumes that the target buffer is at least
	256 characters long. Reading longer variables will create an
	error. Furthermore, this function only supports NUL-terminated
	values (which is generally the case, though).
