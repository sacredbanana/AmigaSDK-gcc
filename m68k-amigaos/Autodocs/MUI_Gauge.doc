	A gauge object is a nice looking display element useful
	for some kind of progress display.
Gauge.mui/MUIA_Gauge_Current

    NAME
	MUIA_Gauge_Current -- (V4 ) [ISG], LONG

    FUNCTION
	Set the current level of the gauge. The value must be
	between 0 and MUIA_Gauge_Max.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Gauge_Max
Gauge.mui/MUIA_Gauge_Divide

    NAME
	MUIA_Gauge_Divide -- (V4 ) [ISG], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	If this attribute is != 0, every value set with
	MUIA_Gauge_Current will be divided by this before
	further processing.

    EXAMPLE
	See BoopsiDoor demo program.

Gauge.mui/MUIA_Gauge_Horiz

    NAME
	MUIA_Gauge_Horiz -- (V4 ) [I..], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	Determine if you want a horizontal or vertical gauge.
	Default to FALSE

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Gauge_Current
Gauge.mui/MUIA_Gauge_InfoText

    NAME
	MUIA_Gauge_InfoText -- (V7 ) [ISG], STRPTR

    FUNCTION
	The text given here is displayed within a gauge object
	and is usually intended to show some kind of percentage
	information.

	This texts preparse is set to "\33c\0338", this makes
	it appear centered and highlighted by default.

	Any %ld will be replaced with the current value of
	MUIA_Gauge_Current.

	Note: Up to V18 of gauge.mui, InfoText worked only for 
	horizontal gauges. If you intend to use and change info
	text, you should specify an empty MUIA_Gauge_InfoText ("")
	at object creation time. This makes your object get
	a fixed height that fits the height of the info text.

	Since version 19 of gauge.mui, you can also use
	MUIA_Gauge_InfoText for vertical gauges. 

    VERSION
	Implemented in version 7 of gauge class (MUI 1.5).
	Version 19 of gauge class (MUI 3.8) enhances this
	attribute to work with vertical gauge objects too.

    EXAMPLE
	...
	MUIA_Gauge_InfoText, "%ld %%",
	...

Gauge.mui/MUIA_Gauge_Max

    NAME
	MUIA_Gauge_Max -- (V4 ) [ISG], LONG

    FUNCTION
	Set the maximum value for the gauge.
	Defaults to 100.

	Currently, MUIA_Gauge_Max and MUIA_Gauge_Current 
	is limited to 16 bit.
