	AddKBInt -- adds a routine to the keyboard interrupt. (V40)

@{b}   SYNOPSIS@{ub}
	intHandle = AddKBInt(intRoutine, intData);
	D0                   A0          A1

	@{"APTR" Link "INCLUDE:exec/types.h/Main" 75} AddKBInt(APTR, APTR);

@{b}   FUNCTION@{ub}
	This routine extends the functionality of the keyboard interrupt to
	include intRoutine. Since this is an extention of the normal
	keyboard interrupt all of the keyboard handshaking is handled. The
	keyboard error codes are filtered out and not passed to intRoutine.

	The routine is called whenever the user enters a key on the
	keyboard.

	The routine is called from within an interrupt, so normal
	restrictions apply. The routine must preserve the following
	registers: A2, A3, A4, A7, D2-D7. Other registers are
	scratch, except for D0, which MUST BE SET TO 0 upon
	exit. On entry to the routine, A1 holds 'intData' and A5
	holds 'intRoutine', and D0 contains the rawkey code read
	from the keyboard.

	The routine is not called when a reset is received from the
	keyboard.

	This is a low level function that does not fit the normal Amiga
	multitasking model. The interrupt installed will have no knowledge
	of which window/screen currently has input focus.

	If your program is to exit without reboot, you MUST call @{"RemKBInt()" Link "RemKBInt()"}
	before exiting.

	Only one interrupt routine may be added to the system.  ALWAYS
	check the return value in case some other task has previously
	used this function.

@{b}   INPUTS@{ub}
	intRoutine - the routine to invoke every vblank. This routine should
		     be as short as possible to minimize its effect on overall
		     system performance.
	intData - data passed to the routine in register A1. If more than one
		  long word of data is required this should be a pointer to
		  a structure that contains the required data.

@{b}   RESULT@{ub}
	intHandle - a handle used to manipulate the interrupt, or @{"NULL" Link "rexxsupport/NULL"}
		    if it was not possible to attach the routine.

@{b}   SYNOPSIS@{ub}
	intHandle = AddTimerInt(intRoutine, intData);
	D0                      A0          A1

	@{"APTR" Link "INCLUDE:exec/types.h/Main" 75} AddTimerInt(APTR, APTR);

@{b}   FUNCTION@{ub}
	Calling this routine causes the system to allocate a @{"CIA" Link "INCLUDE:hardware/cia.h/Main" 27} timer
	and set up 'intRoutine' to service any interrupts caused by the timer.
	Although the timer is allocated it is neither running, nor enabled.
	StartIntTimer() must be called to establish the time interval and
	start the timer.

	The routine is called from within an interrupt, so normal
	restrictions apply. The routine must preserve the following
	registers: A2, A3, A4, A7, D2-D7. Other registers are
	scratch, except for D0, which MUST BE SET TO 0 upon
	exit. On entry to the routine, A1 holds 'intData' and A5
	holds 'intRoutine'.

	Only a single @{"CIA" Link "INCLUDE:hardware/cia.h/Main" 27} timer will be allocated by this routine. So this
	routine may only be called once without an intervening call to
	@{"RemTimerInt()" Link "RemTimerInt()"}.

	The @{"CIA" Link "INCLUDE:hardware/cia.h/Main" 27} timer used by this routine is not guaranteed to always be
	the same. This routine utilizes the @{"CIA" Link "INCLUDE:hardware/cia.h/Main" 27} resource and uses an
	unallocated @{"CIA" Link "INCLUDE:hardware/cia.h/Main" 27} timer.

	If your program is to exit without reboot, you MUST match all
	calls to this function with calls to @{"RemTimerInt()" Link "RemTimerInt()"} before exiting.

	Even if you only use the function once in your program; checking
	the return value will make your program more tolerant for
	mulititasking on the Amiga computer platforms.

	ULONG ElapsedTime(struct @{"EClockVal" Link "INCLUDE:devices/timer.h/Main" 100} *);

@{b}   FUNCTION@{ub}
	This function utilizes the @{"timer.device/ReadEClock()" Link "timer/ReadEClock()"} function to get
	an accurate elapsed time value. Since the context needs to be
	established the first call to this routine will return a nonsense
	value.

	The return value for this function only allows for sixteen bits
	worth for the integer number of seconds and sixteen bits for the
	factional number of seconds.

	With sixteen bits worth of integer seconds this function can be
	used to timer an interval up to about 16 hours. If the actual time
	interval is larger this function will return this maximum value.

	The sixteen bits for fractional seconds gives a resolution of
	approximately 20 microseconds. However, it is not recomended
	to expect this function to be accurate for a time interval of
	less than 200 microseconds.

@{b}   INPUTS@{ub}
	context - pointer to an @{"EClockVal" Link "INCLUDE:devices/timer.h/Main" 100} structure. The first time you
		  call this function, you should initialize the structure
		  to 0s. You should then reuse the same structure for
		  subsequent calls to this function, as this is how the
		  elapsed time is calculated.

@{b}   RESULT@{ub}
	fractionalSeconds - The elapsed time as a fixed point 32-bit
	                    number with the point fixed in the middle.
	                    That is, the upper order sixteen bits represent
	                    the number of seconds elapsed. The low order
	                    sixteen bit represent the fractional number of
	                    seconds elapsed. This value is limited to about
	                    sixteen hours. Although this value is precise
	                    to nearly 20 microseconds it is only accurate to
	                    within 200 microseconds.

@{b}   WARNING@{ub}
	The first call to this function will return a non-sense value. Only
	rely on its result starting with the second call.

	ULONG ReadJoyPort(ULONG);

@{b}   FUNCTION@{ub}
	This function is used to determine what device is attached to the
	joy port and the current position/button state. The user may attach
	a mouse, game controller, or joystick to the port and this function
	will dynamically detect which device is attached and return the
	appropriatly formatted portState.

	To determine the type of controller that is attached, this function
	clocks the game controller and/or interprets changes in the joy
	port data. Valid clocked data from the game controller is immediately
	detected. However, to accuratly determine if a mouse or joystick is
	attached, several calls to this function are required along with some
	movement at the joy port by the user.

	This function always executes immediatly.

	This is a low level single threaded function that does not fit the
	normal Amiga multitasking model. Only one task can be executing
	this routine at any time. All others will return immediately with
	JP_TYPE_NOTAVAIL.

	The nature of this routine is not meant to encourage non-multitasking
	friendly programming practices like polling loops. If your task
	is waiting for a transition to be returned use a @{"WaitTOF()" Link "graphics/WaitTOF()"} between
	calls to minimize the total system impact.

	When called the first time, for each port, this function attempts to
	acquire certain system resources. In order to aquire these resources
	this function MUST be called from a task, or a DOS process. If this
	function fails to aquire the necessary resources, it will
	return with JP_TYPE_NOTAVAIL. Once the resources are aquired (return
	value other than JP_TYPE_NOTAVAIL) this function may be used in
	interrupts.

@{b}   INPUTS@{ub}
	portNumber - port to read, in the range 0 to 3.

@{b}   RESULT@{ub}
	portState - bit map that identifies the device and the current
	            state of that device. The format of the bit map is
	            dependant on the type of device attached.

	            The following constants from @{"<libraries/lowlevel.h>" Link "INCLUDE:libraries/lowlevel.h/Main" 0}
	            are used to determine which device is attached and
	            the state of that device.

	            The type of device can be determined by applying
	            the mask JP_TYPE_MASK to the return value and comparing
	            the resultant value with the following:

	                JP_TYPE_NOTAVAIL        port data unavailable

	            If type = JP_TYPE_GAMECTLR the bit map of portState is:

@{b}   FUNCTION@{ub}
	This function allows modification of several attributes held by
	@{"ReadJoyPort()" Link "ReadJoyPort()"} about both it's operation and the type of controller
	currently plugged into the port.

	ReadJoyPort()'s default behavior is to attempt to automatically
	sense the type of controller plugged into any given port, when
	asked to read that port. This behavior is beneficial, to allow
	simple detection of the type of controller plugged into the port.
	Unfortunately, rare cases are possible where extremely fine
	mouse movements appear to be real joystick movements. Also, this
	ability to auto-sense the controller type causes most reads to
	take longer than if there were no auto-sensing.

	SetJoyPortAttrs() is intended to provide for both of these cases.
	It allows the programmer to notify @{"ReadJoyPort()" Link "ReadJoyPort()"} to stop spending
	time attempting to sense which type of controller is in use -- and,
	optionally, to force @{"ReadJoyPort()" Link "ReadJoyPort()"} into utilizing a certain
	controller type.

@{b}   INPUTS@{ub}
	portNumber - the joyport in question (0-3).
	tagList - a pointer to an array of tags providing parameters
	          to SetJoyPortAttrs(); if @{"NULL" Link "rexxsupport/NULL"}, the function
	          will return TRUE, but do nothing.

@{b}   TAGS@{ub}

			@{"ReadJoyPort()" Link "ReadJoyPort()"} will attempt to determine the type of
			controller plugged into the given port automatically.

	SystemControlA - Method for selectively disabling OS features. (V40)
	SystemControl - varargs stub for SystemControlA().

@{b}   SYNOPSIS@{ub}
	failTag = SystemControlA(tagList);
	D0                       A1

	ULONG SystemControlA(struct @{"TagItem" Link "INCLUDE:utility/tagitem.h/Main" 30} *);

	failTag = SystemControl(firstTag, ...);

	ULONG SystemControl(Tag, ...);

@{b}   FUNCTION@{ub}
	This function is used to alter the operation of the system. Some of
	the alterations involve controlling what are normally regarded as
	system resources. In order to minimize confusion only one task is
	allowed to control any part of the system resources. This prevents
	the possiblity of two tasks fighting, each controlling a part of the
	system. If a tag is identified as task exclusive, it means that
	only one task can hold (set to TRUE) that tag. If
	another task attempts to set the same tag to TRUE, the call to
	SystemControl() will fail.

	It is important to remember that SystemControl() can fail.

	This is a low level function and certain tags do not fit the normal
	Amiga multitasking model.

@{b}   INPUTS@{ub}
	tagList - pointer to an array of tags listing the features of the
	          system to be enabled/disabled.

@{b}   TAGS@{ub}
	SCON_TakeOverSys (BOOL)
		TRUE -	Takes over the CPU to ensure that a program gets every
			ounce of CPU time (with the exception of crucial
			interrupts). When in this mode, the CPU will belong
			completely to the program. @{"Task" Link "INCLUDE:exec/tasks.h/Main" 23} switching will be
			disabled and the program will get all CPU cycles. This
			means any calls to the OS that involve multitasking in
			some way will not execute correctly. Other tasks will
			not run until this tag is used with FALSE. However,
			during a @{"Wait()" Link "exec/Wait()"} on a signal, multitasking will
			automatically be turned back on until the signal is
			received. Once received, multitasking will again be
			disabled and the CPU will be exclusive to the owning
			program.
		FALSE - Relinquishes the CPU and reenables multitasking.
			This tag is task exculsive. This tag nests. A task may
			take over the CPU several times before relinquishing
			it.

	SCON_KillReq (BOOL)
	       TRUE - 	Disables system requesters.  These are the reasons for
			NOT disabling system requesters:

	                    1- No calls in the program will cause a system
			       requester.
	                    2- The only thing that could cause a requester
			       to appear is the lack of a CD in the drive and
			       SCON_CDReboot is set to CDReboot_On, therefore a
			       requester can't appear.
	    		    3- The only disk I/O is via a CD with SCON_CDReboot
			       set to CDReboot_On and/or nonvolatile.library.

	    		When requesters should not be disabled.
	    		GAME PROGRAMS:
	    		No DOS calls are used after loading; or SCON_CDReboot
			is CDReboot_On; and nonvolatile.library is used for
			loading and saving user data.

	    		This fits the above case since; After loading either
			DOS calls are not used fitting reason 1, or the game
			is accessing the CD and has SCON_CDReboot set to
			CDReboot_On fitting reason 2. The game accesses high
			scores, game position, etc through nonvolatile.library,
			fitting reason 3.

		FALSE -	Enables requesters for the program.

	    This tag nests. Tasks may disable requesters several times before
	    enabling them.  However, there must be a matching number of calls.

	SCON_CDReboot (ULONG)
		CDReboot_On - Ejecting the CD will cause a reboot of the
			system. Use this only if the program cannot deal with
			error conditions.
		CDReboot_Off - Ejecting the CD will not cause a reboot of the
	    		system. Use this if the program needs to insert CDs
			while running.
		CDReboot_Default - Restore the default reboot behavior for this
			system. This should be used upon exit, if this tag had
			been used to change the reboot behaviour. For the CD32
 			this value is synonomous with CDReboot_On. For Amiga
			computers this value is synonomous with CDReboot_Off.

	    Note that the default reboot behavior differs depending on the
	    platform. If a program requires a specific behavior it must
	    use this function to set the behavior. For example, a CD audio
	    mixer would use this tag with the data CDReboot_Off. This will
	    allow the changing of audio CDs on the game machine as well as
	    Amiga computers.

	    If, however, there is no error detection code at all this tag
	    should be used with the data CDReboot_On.

	    It is hoped that no program will require CDReboot_On. If all
	    programs check for error condition and recover gracefully such a
	    call should never be necessary. With the default behavior the
	    CD32 will always reset on disk ejects, and programs
	    run from Amiga computers will not reset. Thus, leaving the
	    default will increase the market for a program to include both
	    types of platforms.

	    This tag does not nest.

	SCON_StopInput (BOOL) - When TRUE, stops input.device from using any
	    CPU cycles. Also prevents input.device from passing along any
	    events from either the keyboard and/or port 0.

	    This tag is task exclusive. This tag is NOT reversible.
	    Attempting to reverse will result in confused/garbled input
	    events.

	SCON_AddCreateKeys (ULONG) - Starts creating rawkey codes for the
	    joystick/game controller on the given unit. The unit value is
	    checked for validity and must be either 0 or 1. Each different unit
	    used results in some code added to the VBlank interrupt chain.
	    This tag nests. The tag SCON_RemCreateKeys is used to undo this
	    tag. Tasks may create rawkey codes several times before stopping
	    them.

	    Note that when operating in an Intuition window, the controller's
	    blue button is the equivilent of the mouse menu button. Therefore,
	    Intuition will be capturing most blue button events. If
	    notificiation of these events is important, review the
	    documentation for WFLG_RMBTRAP in the
	    @{"intuition.library/OpenWindow()" Link "intuition/OpenWindow()"} autodoc.

	SCON_RemCreateKeys (ULONG) - stops rawkey codes for the joystick/game
	    controller on the given unit. The unit value is checked for
	    validity and must be either 0 or 1.

@{b}   RESULT@{ub}
	failTag - zero if all tags succeeded. A non-zero return indicates a
		  tag that has failed. It is possible that other tags may
	          fail as well.

	          If any tag fails there will be no change in the system due
	          to other tags.
