   NAME
	AvailFonts -- Inquire available memory & disk fonts.

   SYNOPSIS
	error = AvailFonts(buffer, bufBytes, flags);
	                   A0      D0        D1

	LONG AvailFonts( struct AvailFontsHeader *buffer, LONG bufBytes
		ULONG flags );

   FUNCTION
	AvailFonts fills a user supplied buffer with the structure,
	described below, that contains information about all the
	fonts available in memory and/or on disk.  Those fonts
	available on disk need to be loaded into memory and opened
	via OpenDiskFont, those already in memory are accessed via
	OpenFont.  The TextAttr structure required by the open calls
	is part of the information AvailFonts supplies.

	When AvailFonts fails, it returns the number of extra bytes
	it needed to complete the command.  Add this number to your
	current buffer size, allocate a new buffer, and try again.

   INPUTS
	buffer - memory to be filled with struct AvailFontsHeader
		followed by an array of AvailFonts elements, which
		contains entries for the available fonts and their
		names.

	bufBytes - the number of bytes in the buffer
	flags - AFF_MEMORY is set to search memory for fonts to fill
		the structure, AFF_DISK is set to search the disk for
		fonts to fill the structure.  AFF_SCALED is set to
		not filter out memory fonts that are not designed.
		AFF_BITMAP is set to filter out fonts that are not
		stored in Amiga font format, i.e. to filter out
		outline fonts.  Any combination may be specified.
		AFF_TAGGED is set to fill the buffer with TAvailFonts
		elements instead of AvailFonts elements.

		In V46 AFF_OTAG was introduced, it has the reverse
		effect of AFF_BITMAP and filters out all fonts that
		do not have an .otag file, i.e. that are not accesible
		via the bullet API.  When AFF_OTAG and AFF_SCALED are
		both set, or AFF_TYPE is set, each font that is accesible
		via the bullet API and that is freely scalable will be
		shown with an additional entry with a (t)ta_YSize of 0,
		if this entry is absent, the font is not scalable (i.e.
		a non-Amiga bitmap font format that can be converted
		but not scaled by the font engine).

		In V46 AFF_TYPE was introduced, if set, the [t]af_Type
		of disk fonts is not always AFF_DISK, but instead
		AFF_DISK|AFF_BITMAP for bitmap fonts,
		AFF_DISK|AFF_OTAG for .otag fonts,
		AFF_DISK|AFF_OTAG|AFF_SCALED for scalable .otag fonts
		(with a (t)ta_YSize of 0).

   RESULTS
	buffer - filled with struct AvailFontsHeader followed by the
		[T]AvailFonts elements, There will be duplicate entries
		for fonts found both in memory and on disk, differing
		only by type.  The existance of a disk font in the
		buffer indicates that it exists as an entry in a font
		contents file -- the underlying font file has not been
		checked for validity, thus an OpenDiskFont of it may
		fail.
	error - if non-zero, this indicates the number of bytes needed
		for AvailFonts in addition to those supplied.  Thus
		structure elements were not returned because of
		insufficient bufBytes.

   EXAMPLE
	int afShortage, afSize;
	struct AvailFontsHeader *afh;

	...

	afSize = 400;
	do {
	    afh = (struct AvailFontsHeader *) AllocMem(afSize, MEMF_ANY);
	    if (afh) {
	        afShortage = AvailFonts(afh, afSize, AFF_MEMORY|AFF_DISK);
	        if (afShortage) {
	            FreeMem(afh, afSize);
	            afSize += afShortage;
	        }
	    }
	    else {
	        fail("AllocMem of AvailFonts buffer afh failed\n");
	        break;
	    }
	}
	    while (afShortage);

	\*
	 * if (afh) non-zero here, then:
	 * 1. it points to a valid AvailFontsHeader
	 * 2. it must have FreeMem(afh, afSize) called for it after use
	 *\

   BUGS
	Prior to V46, this routine did not find the taglist stored
	in tagged disk fonts when the AFF_TAGGED flag was specified,
	except the font was already loaded to memory.  Fixed in V46.
	Some V45 versions of this routine returned an invalid taglist
	pointer for the Topaz/9 ROM font when AFF_TAGGED was specified.
	Fixed in V45.7.  Prior to V46, versions with fontcache enabled
	returned wrong results if AFF_BITMAP was set different at
	cache creation and cache lookup.

diskfont.library/CloseOutlineFont           diskfont.library/CloseOutlineFont

   NAME
	CloseOutlineFont -- Release a pointer to an outline font. (V47)

   SYNOPSIS
	CloseOutlineFont(outlineFont, list)
	                 A0           A1

	VOID CloseOutlineFont(struct OutlineFont *, struct List *);

   FUNCTION
	This function indicates that the font specified is no longer
	in use. It is used to close a font opened by OpenOutlineFont(),
	so that fonts that are no longer in use do not consume system
	resources.

   INPUTS
	font - a font pointer as returned by OpenOutlineFont().

	list - the same pointer to a struct List (or NULL pointer) that
	       was used for the matching OpenOutlineFont() call.
	       If you want to share the list between tasks, you are
	       responsible for using an appropriate locking mechanism,
	       e.g. a Semaphore.

diskfont.library/DisposeFontContents     diskfont.library/DisposeFontContents

   NAME
	DisposeFontContents -- Free the result from NewFontContents. (V34)

   SYNOPSIS
	DisposeFontContents(fontContentsHeader)
			    A1

	VOID DisposeFontContents( struct FontContentsHeader * );

   FUNCTION
	This function frees the array of FontContents entries
	returned by NewFontContents.

   INPUTS
	fontContentsHeader - a struct FontContentsHeader pointer
	    returned by NewFontContents.

   EXCEPTIONS
 	This command was first made available as of version 34.

	A fontContentsHeader other than one acquired by a call
	NewFontContents will crash.

   SEE ALSO
	NewFontContents to get structure freed here.

diskfont.library/ECloseEngine                   diskfont.library/ECloseEngine

    NAME
	ECloseEngine -- Release an engine handle. (V47)

    SYNOPSIS
	ECloseEngine(EEngine)
	             A0

	VOID ECloseEngine(struct EGlyphEngine *);

    FUNCTION
	This function is similar to bullet.library/CloseEngine() but does
	not use a (hidden) "BulletBase" variable that may hold the library
	base of the wrong font engine if not set properly. It uses
	EEngine->ege_BulletBase as base of the font engine library to be
	called.

	This function releases the engine handle acquired with EOpenEngine().
	It first releases any data acquired with EObtainInfoA() associated
	with the engine handle that has not yet been released.

    INPUTS
	EEngine - the handle acquired via EOpenEngine(). If NULL or
	          EEngine->ege_GlyphEngine is NULL, no operation is
	          performed.

    RESULT
	EEngine->ege_GlyphEngine is set to NULL. The only error that
	can occur is when an invalid engine handle is supplied: the
	application is assumed not to do that.

    EXAMPLE
	EndGame(code, arg1, arg2, arg3, arg3)
	{
	    ...
	    if (EEngine->ege_GlyphEngine != NULL)
		ECloseEngine(EEngine);
	    if (EEngine->ege_BulletBase != NULL)
		CloseLibrary(EEngine->ege_BulletBase);
	    ...

diskfont.library/EObtainInfoA                   diskfont.library/EObtainInfoA

    NAME
	EObtainInfoA -- Inquire tagged font and/or glyph metrics. (V47)
	EObtainInfo -- varargs form of EObtainInfoA.

    SYNOPSIS
	error = EObtainInfoA(EEngine, tagList)
	D0                   A0       A1

	ULONG EObtainInfoA(struct EGlyphEngine *, struct TagItem *);

	error = EObtainInfo(EEngine, firstTag, ...)

	ULONG EObtainInfo(struct EGlyphEngine *, Tag, ...);

    FUNCTION
	This function is similar to bullet.library/ObtainInfoA() but does
	not use a (hidden) "BulletBase" variable that may hold the library
	base of the wrong font engine if not set properly. It uses
	EEngine->ege_BulletBase as base of the font engine library to be
	called.

	This function accepts a tag list whose tag field elements are
	valid for inquiry, and whose associated data fields are
	pointers to the destination in which to place the requested
	data.

	Tag items that refer to data indirectly (OT_Indirect is set)
	return pointers that may be allocated or cached by the
	library. This data must be treated as read-only data. When
	the application is done with the data acquired via EObtainInfoA(),
	it must perform a EReleaseInfoA() to allow the library to release
	the data.

    INPUTS
	EEngine - the glyph engine acquired via EOpenEngine() or
	          OpenOutlineFont().
	tagList - a tag list containing OT_ tags valid for inquiry
	          paired with the destination pointers for the
	          inquiry results. All destinations are longwords,
	          whether they are pointers or values, and
	          regardless of whether the value could fit in a
	          smaller variable.

    RESULT
	This function returns a zero success indication, or a non-zero
	error code.

    WARNING
	The function may return with a non-zero error code before it has
	parsed the whole tag list. The function may not set the pointers
	you passed in to NULL when an error occured. Be careful to ensure
	that either the pointers you pass in are set to NULL or that
	you only call EReleaseInfoA() if EObtainInfoA() returned no error
	code and the EObtainInfoA() tag list did contain only one pointer.

    EXAMPLE
	struct GlyphMap *glyph;
	...
	if (!(error = EObtainInfo(EEngine, OT_GlyphMap, &glyph, TAG_END)))
	{
	    ...
	    EReleaseInfo(EEngine, OT_GlyphMap, glyph, TAG_END);
	}

diskfont.library/EOpenEngine                     diskfont.library/EOpenEngine

    NAME
	EOpenEngine -- Acquire engine handle. (V47)

    SYNOPSIS
	success = EOpenEngine(EEngine)
	D0                    A0

	LONG EOpenEngine(struct EGlyphEngine *)

    FUNCTION
	This function is similar to bullet.library/OpenEngine() but does
	not use a (hidden) "BulletBase" variable that may hold the library
	base of the wrong font engine if not set properly. It uses
	EEngine->ege_BulletBase as base of the font engine library to be
	called.

	This function establishes a context for access to the bullet
	library or another font engine. This context remains valid until
	it is closed via ECloseEngine(). Each specific context isolates the
	specification of the various font attributes from other contexts
	concurrently accessing the same library. A context can be shared
	among different tasks if the caller uses a locking mechanism (e.g.
	Semaphores) that ensures that the context is not accessed
	concurrently and that e.g. a ESetInfo(), EObtainInfo() sequence
	cannot be interrupted by another task using the same context.

    INPUTS
	EEngine - pointer to a struct EGlyphEngine that does contain
	          a pointer to the library base of the font engine
	          acquired via OpenLibrary() in EEngine->ege_BulletBase.

    RESULT
	If TRUE, EEngine->ege_GlyphEngine contains a pointer to a
	struct GlyphEngine, if FALSE, EEngine->ege_GlyphEngine is NULL.

    EXAMPLE
	struct EGlyphEngine EEngine;

	EEngine.ege_BulletBase = OpenLibrary(EngineName, 0);
	if (!EEngine.ege_BulletBase)
	    EndGame(ERROR_LibOpen, EngineName, 0);
	if (!EOpenEngine(&EEngine))
	    EndGame(ERROR_InternalCall, "EOpenEngine");

	ESetInfo(&EEngine, OT_OTagPath, ...)
	...

	ECloseEngine(&EEngine);
	CloseLibrary(EEngine->ege_BulletBase);

diskfont.library/EReleaseInfoA                 diskfont.library/EReleaseInfoA

    NAME
	EReleaseInfoA -- Release data obtained with EObtainInfoA. (V47)
	EReleaseInfo -- varargs form of EReleaseInfoA.

    SYNOPSIS
	error = EReleaseInfoA(EEngine, tagList)
	D0                    A0       A1

	ULONG EReleaseInfoA(struct EGlyphEngine *, struct TagItem *);

	error = EReleaseInfo(EEngine, firstTag, ...)

	ULONG EReleaseInfo(struct EGlyphEngine *, Tag, ...);

    FUNCTION
	This function is similar to bullet.library/ReleaseInfoA() but does
	not use a (hidden) "BulletBase" variable that may hold the library
	base of the wrong font engine if not set properly. It uses
	EEngine->ege_BulletBase as base of the font engine library to be
	called.

	This function releases the data obtained with EObtainInfoA().
	Data associated with tags that are not indirect, i.e. for which
	OT_Indirect is not set, need not be released, but it is not an
	error to do so. Released data may be immediately freed or may
	become a candidate to be expunged from memory when the system
	reaches a low memory condition, depending on the library's
	internal implementation.

	Each EReleaseInfoA() tag item must be associated with a prior
	successfull EObtainInfoA() call.

    INPUTS
	EEngine - the glyph engine acquired via EOpenEngine() or
	          OpenOutlineFont().
	tagList - a tag list containing OT_ tags valid for inquiry
	          paired with the data previously acquired for them
	          with EObtainInfoA. NULL pointers are quietly
	          accepted and ignored for indirect data.

    RESULT
	This function has no result. The only error that can occur is
	when the EObtainInfo() and EReleaseInfo() pairs are mismatched:
	the application is assumed not to do that.

    EXAMPLE
	struct GlyphMap *glyph;
	...
	if (!(error = EObtainInfo(EEngine, OT_GlyphMap, &glyph, TAG_END)))
	{
	    ...
	    EReleaseInfo(EEngine, OT_GlyphMap, glyph, TAG_END);

    NAME
	ESetInfoA -- Set font and/or glyph metrics. (V47)
	ESetInfo -- varargs form of ESetInfoA.

    SYNOPSIS
	error = ESetInfoA(EEngine, tagList)
	D0                A0       A1

	ULONG ESetInfoA(struct EGlyphEngine *, struct TagItem *);

	error = ESetInfo(EEngine, firstTag, ...)

	ULONG ESetInfo(struct EGlyphEngine *, Tag, ...);

    FUNCTION
	This function is similar to bullet.library/SetInfoA() but does
	not use a (hidden) "BulletBase" variable that may hold the library
	base of the wrong font engine if not set properly. It uses
	EEngine->ege_BulletBase as base of the font engine library to be
	called.

	This function accepts a tag list whose tag field elements are
	valid for specification, and whose associated data fields are
	used to supply the specified data.

	Data that is supplied via an indirect pointer (OT_Indirect is set)
	to an array or structure is copied from that array or structure
	into the internal memory of the library. Changes to the data
	after this call do not affect the engine.

    INPUTS
	EEngine - the glyph engine acquired via EOpenEngine() or
	          OpenOutlineFont().
	tagList - a tag list containing OT_ tags valid for
	          specification paired with the specification data.

    RESULT
	This function returns a zero success indication, or a non-zero
	error code.

    NOTES
	The function may return with a non-zero error code before it has
	parsed the whole tag list.

    EXAMPLE
	// Get Euro glyph with 16 points height
	if (!(error = ESetInfo(EEngine, OT_PointHeight, 0x00100000,
		OT_GlyphCode, 0x20AC, TAG_END)))
	{
	    if (!(error = EObtainInfo(EEngine, OT_GlyphMap, &glyph, TAG_END)))
	    {
		...
		EReleaseInfo(EEngine, OT_GlyphMap, glyph, TAG_END);

   NAME
       GetDiskFontCtrl -- Inquire diskfont global settings. (V45)

   SYNOPSIS
       value = GetDiskFontCtrl( tagid );
                                 D0

       LONG GetDiskFontCtrl( LONG tagitem );


   FUNCTION
       GetDiskFontCtrl reads global settings of the diskfont
       library, as the setting of the base DPI X and Y values,
       the cache enable flag and the AvailFonts sorting values.
       The TagItem passed in identifies the type of data item
       to read.

   INPUTS
       tagid - a tag ID as documented in diskfont/diskfonttag.h
               that identifies the kind of data item to inquiry.

               The following tag values are currently supported:
               (see diskfont/diskfonttag.h)

               Font generator DPI settings:

               DFCTRL_XDPI
               DFCTRL_YDPI     X and Y dpi device resolution

               DFCTRL_XDOTP
               DFCTRL_YDOTP    X and Y dpi dot sizes.

               DFCTRL_CACHE    AvailFonts cache enable (BOOL)

               DFCTRL_SORTMODE AvailFonts font sorting (LONG)

               currently defined sort orders are:

                       DFCTRL_SORT_OFF don't sort
                       DFCTRL_SORT_ASC localized ascending
                       DFCTRL_SORT_DES localized descending

   RESULTS
       value  - The current diskfont default setting for the
                selected tag item.
                The result code is undocumented if an unknown
                tag value is passed in.

   EXAMPLE

       BOOL cache;

       cache = GetDiskFontCtrl(DFCTRL_CACHE);

       \* read the current cache enable flag. *\


   NOTES
       This call is not semaphore protected. This means that
       several calls to this function and SetDiskFontCtrl()
       might cause inconsistent results. The function will not
       fail or crash, but the result might be near to useless
       in a multitasking system.
       This function should never be called by the average
       user. Its sole purpose is to provide the font
       preferences editor with data about the current diskfont
       settings. It should not be called for other purposes.

	NewFontContents -- Create a FontContents image for a font. (V34)

   SYNOPSIS
	fontContentsHeader = NewFontContents(fontsLock,fontName)

	struct FontContentsHeader *NewFontContents( BPTR, char * );

   FUNCTION
	This function creates a new array of FontContents entries
	that describe all the fonts associated with the fontName,
	specifically, all those in the font directory whose name
	is that of the font sans the ".font" suffix.

   INPUTS
	fontsLock - a DOS lock on the FONTS: directory (or other
	    directory where the font contents file and associated
	    font directory resides).
	fontName - the font name, with the ".font" suffix, which
	    is also the name of the font contents file.

   RESULT
	fontContentsHeader - a struct FontContentsHeader pointer.

   EXCEPTIONS
	This command was first made available as of version 34.

	D0 is zero if the fontName is does not have a ".font" suffix,
	if the fontName is too long, if a DOS error occurred, or if
	memory could not be allocated for the fontContentsHeader.

   NAME
	NewScaledDiskFont -- Create a DiskFont scaled from another. (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	header = NewScaledDiskFont(srcFont, destTextAttr)
	D0                         A0       A1

	struct DiskFontHeader *NewScaledDiskFont( struct TextFont *,
		struct TTextAttr * );

   INPUTS
	srcFont - the font from which the scaled font is to be
	    constructed.
	destTextAttr - the desired attributes for the new scaled
	    font.  This may be a structure of type TextAttr or
	    TTextAttr.

   RESULT
	header - a pointer to a DiskFontHeader structure.  This is not
		being managed by the diskfont.library, however.

   NOTES
	o   This function may use the blitter.
	o   Fonts containing characters that render wholly outside
	    the character advance cell are currently not scalable.
	o   The font, and memory allocated for the scaled font can
	    can be freed by calling StripFont() on the font,
	    and then calling UnLoadSeg() on the segment created
	    by this function.

	    Both the TextFont structure, and segment pointer are contained
	    within the DiskFontHeader struct.  The DiskFontHeader structure
	    will also be freed as part of the UnLoadSeg() call.
	    StripFont() is a new graphics.library call as of V36.

diskfont.library/OpenDiskFont                   diskfont.library/OpenDiskFont

   NAME
       OpenDiskFont -- Load and get a pointer to a disk font.

   SYNOPSIS
       font = OpenDiskFont(textAttr)
       D0                  A0

   FUNCTION
       This function finds the font with the specified textAttr on
       disk, loads it into memory, and returns a pointer to the font
       that can be used in subsequent SetFont and CloseFont calls.
       It is important to match this call with a corresponding
       CloseFont call for effective management of font memory.

       If the font is already in memory, the copy in memory is used.
       The disk copy is not reloaded.

   INPUTS
       textAttr - a TextAttr structure that describes the text font
               attributes desired.

   RESULTS
       D0 is zero if the desired font cannot be found.

   NOTES
       As of V36, OpenDiskFont() will automatically attempt to
       construct a font for you if:

               You have requested a font size which does not exist
               as a designed font, and

               You have not set the DESIGNED bit in the ta_Flags
               field of the TextAttr, or TTextAttr struct.

       Constructed fonts are created by scaling a designed font.
       A designed font is one which typically resides on disk,
       or in ROM (e.g., a font which has been designed by hand
       using a drawing tool).  Designed fonts generally look better
       than fonts constructed by the font scaler, but designed
       fonts also require disk space for each font size.

       Always set the DESIGNED bit if you do not want constructed fonts,
       or use AvailFonts() to find out which font sizes already exist.

       As of V37 the diskfont.library supported built-in outline
       fonts.  Then in V38 the outline font engine was moved to
       a new library, "bullet.library."

   BUGS
       This routine will not work well with font names whose file
       name components are longer than the maximum allowed
       (30 characters).

   NAME
	OpenOutlineFont -- Search, load, validate and relocate an .otag file,
			   if requested open the font engine library and a
			   glyph engine. (V47)

   SYNOPSIS
	outlinefont = OpenOutlineFont(fileName, list, flags)
	D0                            A0        A1    D0

	struct OutlineFont *OpenOutlineFont(STRPTR fileName,
					    struct List *list, ULONG flags);

   FUNCTION
	This function finds the .otag file for the specified outline font
	on disk, loads it into memory, validates that OT_FileIdent exists
	and matches the file size, validates that OT_Engine exists and
	relocates all OT_Indirect tags. If requested, it opens the font
	engine library and a glyph engine and calls ESetInfo() with the
	appropriate OT_OTagPath and OT_OTagList tags. It returns a pointer
	to a struct OutlineFont.
	It is important to match this call with a corresponding
	CloseOutlineFont() call for effective management of memory.

   INPUTS
	fileName - file or font name to open. If fileName contains a ':',
		   the .otag file will be searched in the path specified
		   with fileName, otherwise it will be searched in FONTS:.
		   The fileName may have either the ".font" or the ".otag"
		   suffix or no suffix (just the font name, e.g.
		   "Nimbus Sans L Regular Condensed Italic"). It is not
		   limited in length.

	list -     ignored when OFF_OPEN not set. A pointer to a struct
		   List that has to be initialized with NewList() before
		   the first call of OpenOutlineFont() and has to be used
		   for every subsequent call of OpenOutlineFont() and
		   CloseOutlineFont(), or NULL. If not NULL, the function
		   uses this list to avoid re-opening font engine libraries
		   for your task that were already opened by a previous
		   call of OpenOutlineFont(). You either must pass the same
		   list for all calls of OpenOutlineFont() and
		   CloseOutlineFont() or always use NULL. If you want to
		   share the list between tasks, you are responsible
		   for using an appropriate locking mechanism, e.g. a
		   Semaphore.

	flags -    currently only OFF_OPEN is specified, when not set,
		   the .otag file is only searched, loaded, validated and
		   relocated and you can e.g. examine the OTagList and
		   decide whether you want to use this font or not.
	           See below how to open the font later.

   RESULTS
	D0 is zero if the desired .otag file cannot be found, loaded or
	validated, the font engine library or glyph engine could not
	be opened or the ESetInfo() call specifying OT_OTagPath and
	OT_OTagList failed. Otherwise D0 points to a struct OutlineFont.

   NOTES
	If you did not set OFF_OPEN and want to open the font later:
	open the font engine library via OpenLibrary() and store it in
	olf_EEngine.ege_BulletBase, if successful call EOpenEngine()
	with the address of olf_EEngine, if successful call ESetInfo()
	with olf_OTagPath and olf_OTagList as OT_OTagPath / OT_OTagList,
	if successful you can use the font. But: you must clean up
	yourself when done (ECloseEngine(), CloseLibrary()) and
	you _must_ set all olf_EEngine members back to NULL before
	calling CloseOutlineFont(). Or just use your own EGlyphEngine
	structure instead.

   EXAMPLE
	struct OutlineFont *outlineFont;

	if (outlineFont = OpenOutlineFont("Helvetica", NULL, OFF_OPEN))
	{
	    if (ESetInfo(&outlineFont->olf_EEngine,
			 OT_DeviceDPI, (XDPI << 16) | YDPI,
			 OT_PointHeight, PointHeight,
			 TAG_END) == OTERR_Success)
	    {
		// Now all is set up to use the font with
		// ESetInfo(), EObtainInfo() and EReleaseInfo()
	    }
	    CloseOutlineFont(outlineFont, NULL);
	}

   NAME
       SetDiskFontCtrlA -- Adjust disk font global settings. (V45)
       SetDiskFontCtrl -- varargs form of SetDiskFontCtrlA.

   SYNOPSIS
       SetDiskFontCtrlA( tags );
                          A0

       void SetDiskFontCtrlA( struct TagItem * );

       void SetDiskFontCtrl( Tag, ... );


   FUNCTION
       SetDiskFontCtrl adjusts the global settings passed in
       in the form of a tag list and installs them into the
       the diskfont internal database. This includes the
       base DPI X and Y values, the cache enable flag and the
       AvailFonts font sorting order.

   INPUTS
       tags -  a tag list defining the global settings that are
               to be adjusted.

               The following tag values are currently supported:
               (see diskfont/diskfonttag.h)

               Font generator DPI settings:

               DFCTRL_XDPI
               DFCTRL_YDPI     X and Y dpi device resolution

               DFCTRL_XDOTP
               DFCTRL_YDOTP    X and Y dpi dot sizes.

               DFCTRL_CACHE    AvailFonts cache enable (BOOL)

               DFCTRL_SORTMODE AvailFonts font sorting (LONG)

               currently defined sort orders are:

                       DFCTRL_SORT_OFF don't sort
                       DFCTRL_SORT_ASC localized ascending
                       DFCTRL_SORT_DES localized descending

               DFCTRL_CACHEFLUSH Flush the cache?      (BOOL)

                       If TRUE, a cache flush is initiated.

   RESULTS


   EXAMPLE

       SetDiskFontCtrl(DFCTRL_CACHE,TRUE,TAG_DONE);

       \* enable the AvailFonts cache. *\


   NOTES
       The SetDiskFontCtrlA() function is the assembly language
       interface which takes the tag list pointer in A0.
       SetDiskFontCtrl() is the stack based wrapper for
       convenient C language calls.

       This call is not semaphore protected. This means that
       several calls to this function and GetDiskFontCtrl()
       might cause inconsistent results. The function will not
       fail or crash, but the result might be near to useless
       in a multitasking system.
       This function should never be called by the average
       user. Its sole purpose is to allow the font
       preferences editor to adjust the diskfont internal
       data in a user friendly way. It should not be called
       for other purposes, especially, applications *MUST NOT*
       call this to enable or disable the cache setting. This
       should be left to the user by selecting the preferences.

   WARNING
	Prior to V46, setting DFCTRL_XDOTP and/or DFCTRL_YDOTP to
	something else than the default (100) may result in the fact
	that diskfont.library is no longer able to create bitmap fonts
	from outline fonts since some font engines dont support
	an OT_DotSize different from the default and return an error.
	Since V46, the font generator now retries with OT_DotSize
	of 100% if the first try failed.
