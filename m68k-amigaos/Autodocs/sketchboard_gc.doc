    NAME
        sketchboard.gadget -- sketchboard gadget class

    SUPERCLASS
        gadgetclass

    REQUIRES
        bevel.image

    DESCRIPTION
        This class is intended to be used to edit smaller bitmaps with a
        limited set of drawing tools. It is used by the Pointer preferences
        as well as the IconEdit utility.

        Special features include bitmap scaling, an optional grid pattern
        and optional hot spot indicator.

    ATTRIBUTES
        GA_ReadOnly (BOOL)
            This attribute overrides the behavior of the superclass
            to set and clear the GFLG_SELECTED flag. Set the gadget to
            read only when accessing the SGA_BitMap.

            Defaults to FALSE.

            Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_UPDATE, OM_GET)

        GA_Disabled (BOOL)
            This attribute overrides the behavior of the superclass
            to also set and clear the GFLG_SELECTED flag.

            Defaults to FALSE.

            Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_UPDATE, OM_GET)

        GA_HintInfo (CONST_STRPTR)
            Specify the text to use as the hint info for this gadget.
            You can change this attribute at any time, and it will over-
            ride any text specified in the windows HintInfo array. See
            window.class autodoc for more information.

            Defaults to NULL.

            Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET).

        SGA_BitMap (struct BitMap *)
            Pointer to the source bitmap which will be copied from
            when used with OM_NEW, OM_SET and OM_UPDATE. This bitmap
            is only read from.

            The sketchboard object always uses its own internal bitmap
            for editing. The internal bitmap can be retrieved using
            this attribute and OM_GET. Set the gadget to GA_ReadOnly
            before invoking OM_GET and be ready to handle a NULL
            pointer if the gadget has not yet been layed out.

            Defaults to NULL (blank).

            Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_UPDATE, OM_GET)

        SGA_MouseX (UWORD)
            The current mouse X coordinate within the drawing area.

            When using OM_GET, initialize the tag value to the
            mouse X coordinate relative to the gadget's bounds.
            This value will then be scaled to provide the mouse X
            coordinate within the drawing area.

            When SGA_Scale is 1 there is no scaling because each
            pixel is exactly one square in the drawing area. When
            SGA_Scale is 2 there are 2 pixels for every one square
            withing the drawing area and so forth.

            Applicability is (OM_GET, OM_NOTIFY)

        SGA_MouseY (UWORD)
            The current mouse Y coordinate within the drawing area.

            When using OM_GET, initialize the tag value to the
            mouse Y coordinate relative to the gadget's bounds.
            This value will then be scaled to provide the mouse Y
            coordinate within the drawing area.

            When SGA_Scale is 1 there is no scaling because each
            pixel is exactly one square in the drawing area. When
            SGA_Scale is 2 there are 2 pixels for every one square
            withing the drawing area and so forth.

            Applicability is (OM_GET, OM_NOTIFY)

        SGA_Width (UWORD)

        SGA_TopLayerBitmap (struct BitMap *)
            A bitmap that acts as top layer on

            tool or selecting another area may dispose the internal
            SGA_TopLayerBitmap.

            After OM_SETting this attribute you can release the bitmap
            as the gadget copies it to its own one.

            For OM_GET this will return a pointer to the gadget's bitmap;
            don't cache this pointer!

            Be prepared to handle NULL pointers (out of memory, no
            selection, or gadget hasn't been layouted).

            NOTE: when setting or getting this you also need to
            do SGA_TopLayerWidth.

            Applicability is (OM_GET, OM_NEW, OM_SET)

        SGA_TopLayerWidth (WORD)

        SGA_MaxUndoSteps (ULONG)
            Defaults to 16. (IS) (V47)

        SGA_UpdatedBitMap (struct BitMap *)
            Exactly the same as SGA_BitMap EXCEPT it doesn't reset the
            change stack, but instead records this update as a step in
            the change stack. (ISG) (V47)

        SGA_MaxScale (ULONG)
            Maximum scale. Defaults to 16.

sketchboard_gc/SKETCHBOARD_GetClass       sketchboard_gc/SKETCHBOARD_GetClass

    NAME
        SKETCHBOARD_GetClass -- Gets pointer to the sketchboard class.

    SYNOPSIS
        sketchboard_class = SKETCHBOARD_GetClass();
        D0

        Class * class = SKETCHBOARD_GetClass();

    FUNCTION
        Obtains the pointer to the sketchboard gadget class for use with
        NewObject().  This function always returns a valid pointer so
        you do not need to check it.  The reason is that if the library
        opens fine, then the pointer returned is already setup.  (Of course
        this implies that if opening the library fails, you shouldn't be
        calling this.)

        Note that this function does not create the class, that is done
        when the class library is opened.

    RESULT
        class - Pointer to the sketchboard class.
