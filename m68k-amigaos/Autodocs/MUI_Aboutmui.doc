Aboutmui.mui/Aboutmui.mui

	This class can be used to display a MUI about window
	in MUI applications. Add a "Project/About MUI..." menu
	item and make it do something like this:

	if (!aboutwin)
	{
		aboutwin = AboutmuiObject,
			MUIA_Window_RefWindow, obj,
			MUIA_Aboutmui_Application, MyAppObject,
			End;
	}

	if (aboutwin)
		set(aboutwin,MUIA_Window_Open,TRUE);
	else
		DisplayBeep(0);

	You don't have to care about the window any longer, it
	will take care about closing itself and will get disposed
	when the application is removed.
