This drawer contains examples for language drivers, such as found in
"LOCALE:languages".

Note that there exist three different types
of drivers that include different versions of the basic driver framework:

- languagecharsetdriver.c is included by drivers that always override the
  charset driver and define all functions themselves.

- languagestrncmpdriver.c is included by drivers that dont have
  the IsAlNum(), IsAlpha() etc functions, no ConvToLower(),
  ConvToUpper() and StrConvert() because the functions in the
  common charset driver are ok for this language. They implement
  StrnCmp(), GetLocaleStr() and GetCodeSet().

- languagedriver.c is like above but without StrnCmp(), when there
  exist no language-specific sorting rules the charset driver provides it.

You basically just need to copy an existing
languagename_MIME-NAME.c source code to
mylanguage_MIME-NAME-OF-MY-CHARSET.c, modify the character property and
conversion tables and the text strings, use BumpRev to create
mylanguage_MIME-NAME-OF-MY-CHARSET_rev.h, add your driver to the makefile
and call "make". You may need the OS4 SDK. You may also need to change the
include paths in the makefiles, e.g. V:include -> ../include plus
SDK:include.
