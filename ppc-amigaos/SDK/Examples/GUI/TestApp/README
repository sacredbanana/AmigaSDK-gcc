README for TestApp

libauto.a is a GCC link library that contains autoinit code for almost all
public ReAction classes. Autoinit of a class is triggered automatically when
the file <proto/classname.h> is included in your program (technically, the
external reference of the interface pointer and library base triggers the
inclusion of object files in the library).

The included sample program "TestApp" is meant both as an example on how to
use the library and as an example for programming with ReAction under
AmigaOS 4.

See the document "Migration Guide.pdf" for more details on what
libraries are covered by libauto.a
