bzip2.library is a simple wrapper for libbzip2. It contains all public functions of
libbzip2 wrapped into a standard Amiga style shared library.

To use it instead of libbz2 in you own program all you have to do is to replace the line

#include <bzlib.h>

by

#include <proto/bzip2.h>
#include <libraries/bzip2.h>

And of course you will have to open bzip2.library and obtain its "main" interface.

All future versions of MUI 3.9 and MUI 4.0 will make heavy use of it since all embedded
images are bzip2 compressed now.

Have lots of phun!
