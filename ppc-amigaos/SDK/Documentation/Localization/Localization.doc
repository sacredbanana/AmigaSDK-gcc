How to localize AmigaOS
-----------------------
For complete support of your language in AmigaOS, you need:

1) An 8 bit charset with all characters needed to write your language.

2) A MIME name and ID for your charset.

3) A mapping table to Unicode for your charset.

4) The topaz font in sizes 8 and 9 in your charset.

5) A charset driver in your charset.

6) A language driver in your charset.

7) A country file in your charset.

8) A keymap for your keyboard and charset.

9) Catalog files in your language.

AmigaOS may already be shipped with some of the needed components, e.g. if we
already created a charset driver you dont need components 1) to 5), and
maybe only some catalog files are missing. But for the worst case we'll
describe the complete procedure below.


Before you begin
----------------
Please look at http://ato.bitbrook.de/ to find out if (some of) the needed
components are already available or if someone else already works on them
so you can eventually combine your efforts.

If you can't find the needed information there, you can ask us.


1) An 8 bit charset with all characters needed to write your language.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have only a vague idea what the term "charset" could mean,
first have a look at Charsets.doc distributed with AmigaOS.

AmigaOS requires an 8 bit charset where the range 0 - 160 is identical to
ISO-8859-1 as system default charset. If the remaining range 161 - 255 is
not large enough for all non-ASCII characters needed to write your
language, you have to wait until AmigaOS supports multibyte charsets.
This excludes e.g. Chinese, Japanese and Taiwanese.

AmigaOS currently only supports the left-to-right writing direction. If your
language is written in another direction you have to wait until AmigaOS
supports e.g. the Unicode bi-directional writing algorithm.
This excludes e.g. Arabic and Hebrew.

AmigaOS does currently not support character combining. There exist scripts
where the visual appearance of a character (its glyph) may be modified
by neighbour characters or marks, e.g. Arabic, Hangul, Syriac. Supporting
those would require a font layout engine and an API for it which doesn't
exist yet for AmigaOS.


2) A MIME name and ID for your charset.
---------------------------------------
An electronic document that gets transferred from one machine to another,
e. g. web pages, news articles or emails, does normally have to be marked
with a special tag that identifies its charset. This is necessary for
the receiving machine to be able to do any necessary charset conversion
or font selection before displaying the document, you e.g. can't display
a greek text with a cyrillic font. The standard tag used for this purpose
is the MIME name.

AmigaOS uses a copy of the IANA charset name registry which can be found at
http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets in
L:Charsets/character-sets. This file contains the MIME character set names
that are allowed to use in electronic documents that conform to the MIME
standard.

AmigaOS does also allow to use non-standard charsets. Those can be found in
L:charsets/custom-character-sets.

In most cases you should be able to use an existing MIME character set.
If you know about a MIME charset that is not listed in
L:Charsets/character-sets, update the file with the latest copy from the
IANA registry. Do NOT edit the file yourself. If you found the MIME name
of your charset, do remember it, and do also remember the "MIBenum"
numeric charset ID.

If you really think it's necessary to define your own custom charset, edit
L:Charsets/custom-character-sets. Give it a name that starts with "X-"
(thats a convention of the MIME standard), keep the name shorter than
40 characters and use US-ASCII, no spaces, for the name. Give it also
a MIBenum numeric charset ID. Don't forget that your custom charset can
only be used on machines that have the charset listed in
L:Charsets/custom-character-sets. It's possible to register new character
sets at IANA, this did e.g. happen with the "Amiga-1251" charset that
was first used for the russian translation of AmigaOS 3.x, the procedure
should be described at the IANA website.


3) A mapping table to Unicode for your charset.
-----------------------------------------------
AmigaOS needs to know the name and ID of your charset, see above, and it
needs to know which characters it does actually contain. It does search
this information in a binary file in L:Charsets/MIME-NAME-OF-YOUR-CHARSET
that describes which character index in your charset matches which
character index in Unicode.

If you don't have such a mapping table yet, first have a look if its placed
in L:Charsets/Storage/, did place some mapping tables there because I
thought most users would not need them. If its there, move it to
L:Charsets/. Otherwise you can create a mapping table with the
BuildMapTable command, see Tools/BuildMapTable_cmd.doc that also describes
where to search for existing table source files and the format of those
files.


4) The topaz font in sizes 8 and 9 in your charset.
---------------------------------------------------
With a MIME charset name and ID and an Unicode mapping table (see above)
you can already use the CharsetConvert tool to convert texts from/to
your charset, you can use TypeManager to create bitmap fonts in your
charset, and you can use NotePad to write texts in your charset.

However, you can't use your charset as system default charset yet, for this
purpose you need a charset driver and a language driver (see below), and
you need topaz/8 and topaz/9 in your charset. diskfont.library has to
guarantee that those two fonts are always available in the system default
charset for compatibility reasons, and it will ask you with an Alert at
boot time if you really want to use your charset if the fonts could not be
found on disk.

If your favorite bitmap font editor is not charset aware yet, do the
following:

- Choose which already existing topaz variant would require the least
  modifications to convert it in your charset. By looking which files
  are in FONTS:topaz/ you can see what exists already. If the files
  8_MINE-NAME-OF-YOUR-CHARSET and 9_MIME-NAME-OF-YOUR-CHARSET do exist
  already, you dont need to create them :) Font files without _MIME_NAME
  extension are normally in ISO-8859-1.

- Load topaz_MIME-NAME-OF-SIMILAR-CHARSET in size 8 (E.g. topaz_ISO-8859-2
  if you want to create a czech charset with Euro sign). This
  fontname_MIME-NAME trick can be used to tell diskfont.library which
  charset you want when the application is not charset aware.

- Modify the font for your charset and save it as "mytopaz" size 8.
  Then load topaz_MIME-NAME-OF-SIMILAR-CHARSET in size 9, modify it
  and save it as mytopaz size 9.

- Call "SetFontCharset FONTS:mytopaz/8 MIME-NAME-OF-MY-CHARSET"
  and  "SetFontCharset FONTS:mytopaz/9 MIME-NAME-OF-MY-CHARSET".
  (See also the documentation of the SetFontCharset command).

- Call "Rename FONTS:mytopaz/8_MIME-NAME-OF-MY-CHARSET FONTS:topaz/"
  and  "Rename FONTS:mytopaz/9_MIME-NAME-OF-MY-CHARSET FONTS:topaz/".

- Call "Delete FONTS:mytopaz#? ALL"

- Call "FixFonts" and you are done.


5) A charset driver in your charset.
------------------------------------
If LOCALE:Charsets/MIME-NAME-OF-YOUR-CHARSET.charset does not exist yet,
you need to create it. Its a system library that implements basic
charset-related functions, e.g. ConvToUpper() or IsAlpha(). If you dont
know how to build an OS4 system library, ask a programmer for help.

Sample sources and makefiles can be found in Examples/Locale/Charsets/.
You basically just need to copy e.g. ISO-8859-15.c to
MIME-NAME-OF-MY-CHARSET.c, modify the character property and conversion
tables, use BumpRev to create MIME-NAME-OF-MY-CHARSET_rev.h, add your
driver to the makefiles and call "make". You may need the OS4 SDK.
You may also need to change the include paths in the makefiles, e.g.
V:include -> ../include plus SDK:include.


6) A language driver in your charset.
-------------------------------------
You can look at LOCALE:Languages/ to see which language drivers do
already exist. Normally, the file names are in english and a _MIME-NAME
extension is added for non-ISO-8859-1 drivers. If in doubt, calling
Prefs/Locale and deleting the list of preferred languages shows you a
list which language drivers for which charset are available (you can quit
without saving the modified settings).

Note that AmigaOS 4 comes with compatibility language drivers for the
custom used in the AmigaOS 3.x localization, these can be found in
Storage/Languages/ (czech, polish, serbian and slovak). If you want to
use one of those, move it to LOCALE:Languages/ and select it as first
preferred language in Prefs/Locale. Normally you should use the new
drivers that use official MIME charsets.

If LOCALE:Languages/mylanguage_MIME-NAME-OF-MY-CHARSET.language does
not exist yet, you need to create it. Its a system library that can
implement basic charset-related functions, e.g. ConvToUpper() or
IsAlpha(), but in most cases it wont implement them and AmigaOS uses the
charset driver as fallback. It may implement special language specific
sorting rules in StrnCmp() if the charset specific rules of the charset
driver are different. And it always contains some text strings for
GetLocaleStr().

If you already have a language driver for your language and charset
but it contains errors or typos in the builtin strings for GetLocaleStr(),
you can fix that without the need to use a C compiler, CatComp is enough.
See Documentation/Tools/BuildLanguageCT how to create a catalog file that
overrides the builtin strings of the language driver.

If you don't know how to build an AmigaOS system library, ask a programmer
for help. Sample sources and makefiles can be found in
Examples/Locale/Languages/. Note that there exist three different types
of drivers that include different versions of the basic driver framework:

- languagecharsetdriver.c is included by drivers that always override the
  charset driver and define all functions themselves.

- languagestrncmpdriver.c is included by drivers that dont have
  the IsAlNum(), IsAlpha() etc functions, no ConvToLower(),
  ConvToUpper() and StrConvert() because the functions in the
  common charset driver are ok for this language. They implement
  StrnCmp(), GetLocaleStr() and GetCodeSet().

- languagedriver.c is like above but without StrnCmp(), when there
  exist no language-specific sorting rules the charset driver provides it.

You basically just need to copy an existing
languagename_MIME-NAME.c source code to
mylanguage_MIME-NAME-OF-MY-CHARSET.c, modify the character property and
conversion tables and the text strings, use BumpRev to create
mylanguage_MIME-NAME-OF-MY-CHARSET_rev.h, add your driver to the makefiles
and call "make". You may need the AmigaOS SDK. You may also need to change
the include paths in the makefiles, e.g. V:include -> ../include plus
SDK:include.


To activate your new language driver, copy it to LOCALE:Languages/,
start Prefs/Locale, clean the list of preferred languages and rebuild it
by selecting your new driver first, select eventually more languages and
save. Only the first driver in the list specifies the system default
language, system default charset and system default sorting rules.
The additional entries in the list do only specify additional directories
to search for catalog files.


7) A country file in your charset.
----------------------------------
If LOCALE:Countries/ does not contain a country file for your country
(those files specify date and time formats, currency etc) you need one.
If it contains a country file you can use it in most cases, except it
contains text (often curreny strings) in a charset that is not compatible
to your charset. There exists a program on Aminet called CountryEdit
that is able to tell you which settings and strings are stored in a
country file.

If you want to create a new country file, have a look at
Examples/Locale/Countries/ which contains the source code of a program
that can create them. You just have to add a new country definition,
compile and run the program. If you are no programmer and can't ask one
for help, you can try to build a country file with CountryEdit. However,
this program is not aware of the new "builtin native name in native
charset" feature used by AmigaOS Prefs/Locale so the native country name
may get lost.

The naming rules for country files are: English, US-ASCII filename,
native name in native charset is stored in the file, variants are named
CountryName_Variant.country. Example:

Switzerland_french.country  ("Suisse")
Switzerland_german.country  ("Schweiz")
Switzerland_italian.country ("Svizzera")

Copying a country file to LOCALE:Countries/ does not "activate" it,
you have to start Prefs/Locale, select it and save the settings for this.

You can also create a flag image for your new country file if none does
exist in LOCALE:Flags/Countries/. Prefs/Locale searches for "CountryName"
when "CountryName_Variant" cant be found.


8) A keymap for your keyboard and charset.
------------------------------------------
(See also the Keymaps.doc file released with AmigaOS.)
If you can find a keymap in KEYMAPS: that describes your keyboard and
is written in the same charset than yours or a "compatible" charset
that contains the same or more characters, you can use it. Prefs/Input
shows which keymaps are available. After selecting one, Tools/KeyShow
shows you which keys do produce which characters in combination with
which Qualifier keys (Shift, Alt, Ctrl).

KeyShow doesn't show which characters are produced by deadkey combinations
but that doesn't matter because keymap.library does automatically adjust
the deadkey combinations of a keymap to the current system default
charset when the keymap is in the new text file format. This means you will
always get a Z with acute accent after typing the deadkey for acute accent
followed by a capital Z when your charset contains this character.

If your keyboard is not described by a file in KEYMAPS:, start with a copy
of a similar keymap file and edit it, see Keymaps.doc for details. You
can use the CharsetConvert command to change the charset of the copied
keymap file, dont forget to change the CHARSET and LOCALEINFOCHARSET lines
after doing this.

You can also create a flag image for your new keymap file if none does
exist in LOCALE:Flags/Keymaps/. Prefs/Input searches for "name" when
"name_variant" cant be found.


9) Catalog files in your language.
----------------------------------
You can use CatComp (see Documentation/Tools/CatComp.doc) to create a
missing catalog file in your language for your favorite application or
OS component. Note that locale.library is able to convert the charset of a
catalog file during load so you can e.g. use any existing slovak catalog
regardless if it is in X-ATO-E2 (which was used for the AmigaOS 3.x slovak
catalogs) or in ISO-8859-2.

The CharSetConvert command can be used to convert existing catalog
translation (.ct) files if you want to switch the charset. Dont forget
to change the ##codeset entry to the MIME charset ID of the new charset
afterwards.

In AmigaOS 3.x some language names did contain non-ASCII characters which
could result in charset problems with the directory names used to store
catalog files. For example francais (with a c with cedilla, this text is
in ASCII) is displayed with a greek character in the middle when the user
uses a greek charset. The AmigaOS 4 locale.library prefers english,
US-ASCII file and directory names ("french" in this example) but does
fallback to search in the old directories for backwards compatibility.
However, you are encouraged to switch to the new names, which are specified
with the ##language entry in a .ct file.

It follows a list of compatibility assumptions built into the AmigaOS 4
locale.library, you may need it when you want to convert existing .ct
files to a different charset. The charset assumption is only made when
the old name was used and codeset 0 was specified. For the new names
codeset 0 is assumed to mean 4 (ISO-8859-1). The old language names are
in ISO-8859-1:

Old language name | New language name | Assumed charset
------------------+-------------------+----------------
bosanski           bosnian             ISO-8859-1

*1 - The persian "IPJ" charset used by Paymaan Jafari for localizing parts
     of AmigaOS 3.x is not supported in AmigaOS 4. We would need at least
     a mapping table of the charset to Unicode.

*2 - Existing korean catalogs for AmigaOS 3.x are in EUC-KR, a multibyte
     character set that is not yet supported by AmigaOS 4.

*3 - Existing japanese catalogs for AmigaOS 3.x are in EUC-JP, a multibyte
     character set that is not yet supported by AmigaOS 4.

Its also possible in AmigaOS 4 to create more than one catalog for a language,
e.g. an extra full featured version in UTF-8 for future compatibility and
an extra US-ASCII only version that can be displayed in all charsets.
See the autodoc for OpenCatalog() for details.

A note to the developers: If the builtin strings of your application
are in english but contain non-ASCII characters (copyright sign,
registered sign, middle dot etc), don't forget that this may cause
charset problems (on e.g. a greek system without a greek catalog).
To avoid that, make the distinction between an english string and
a default string.

The default builtin strings of your application should be ASCII only
and you should pass 'OC_BuiltInLanguage, "ASCIIenglish"' to OpenCatalog.
Then you create an english .ct file in e.g. ISO-8859-1 which includes
the non-ASCII characters and create an english .catalog file from it
with CatComp. This catalog file does only contain the strings with
non-ASCII characters and is only loaded when the user did select "english"
as one of the preferred languages.

Another note to the developers: Please make all strings in your
applications localizable, including the format strings for FormatDate(),
FormatString(), RawDoFmt() etc. Some languages may require localized
versions of those for good readability.

A note to the translators: The AmigaOS 4 version of FormatString()
(which also replaces RawDoFmt() after IPrefs was started) has a new
feature, you can force the first character of a word to uppercase or
lowercase. The AmigaOS 4 version of FormatDate() has support for
alternate weekday and month names, forced case of many names, and
suppression of leading zeros. See the autodocs for details.

Have fun,
