    NAME
	modelclass -- base model class

    SUPERCLASS
	icclass

    REQUIRES
	None

    DESCRIPTION
	A class of OM_UPDATE forwarding objects that have multiple targets.
	In addition to the features the modelclass object inherits from
	icclass, when a modelclass object gets an OM_UPDATE message, it
	forwards that OM_UPDATE message to all of the objects in its
	broadcast list.

    METHODS
	OM_NEW -- Create the modelclass object. Passed to superclass.

	OM_DISPOSE -- Destroys object and all member objects and then
	              passed to superclass.

	OM_UPDATE -- Updates all members of attribute change.

	OM_NOTIFY -- Notifies all members of attribute change.

	OM_ADDMEMBER -- Add object to broadcast list.

	OM_REMMEMBER -- Remove object from broadcast list.

	All other methods are passed to the superclass.

modelclass/OM_ADDMEMBER                                   modelclass/OM_ADDMEMBER

    NAME
	OM_ADDMEMBER -- Add an object to member list.

    SYNOPSIS
	uint32 result = IDoMethodA(APTR obj, struct opMember * msg);

    FUNCTION
	This method tells a model to add an object to its broadcast list.
	When the object disposes of itself it will also dispose of any
	objects remaining on its broadcast list.

    INPUTS
	obj - modelclass object pointer
	msg - pointer to fully initialized struct opMember
	      (see <intuition/classusr.h>)

    RESULT
	The return value is not explicitly defined.

    SEE ALSO
	OM_REMMEMBER, rootclass/OM_REMMEMBER

modelclass/OM_DISPOSE                                       modelclass/OM_DISPOSE

    NAME
	OM_DISPOSE -- Destroy the object and all members.

    SYNOPSIS
	uint32 result = IDoMethodA(APTR obj, Msg msg);

    FUNCTION
	This method tells a model to dispose of itself plus the
	objects remaining on its broadcast list.

    INPUTS
	obj - modelclass object pointer
	msg - Msg with MethodID = OM_DISPOSE
	      (see <intuition/classusr.h>)

    RESULT
	The return value is not explicitly defined.

    SEE ALSO

modelclass/OM_NOTIFY                                         modelclass/OM_NOTIFY

    NAME
	OM_NOTIFY -- Broadcast update to all modelclass members.

    SYNOPSIS
	uint32 result = IDoMethodA(APTR obj, struct opUpdate * msg);

    FUNCTION
	This method tells a modelclass object to forward the message in
	the form of an OM_UPDATE message to all the objects in its broadcast
	list. The modelclass does not map the attributes in these OM_UPDATE
	messages. Because modelclass inherits behavior from icclass, if the
	model has an ICA_TARGET and ICA_MAP, it will also send a mapped
	OM_UPDATE message to its ICA_TARGET.

    INPUTS
	obj - modelclass object pointer
	msg - pointer to fully initialized struct opUpdate
	      (see <intuition/classusr.h>)

    RESULT
	The return value is not explicitly defined.

    SEE ALSO
	OM_UPDATE, rootclass/OM_NOTIFY, icclass/OM_NOTIFY

modelclass/OM_REMMEMBER                                   modelclass/OM_REMMEMBER

    NAME
	OM_REMMEMBER -- Remove an object from member list.

    SYNOPSIS
	uint32 result = IDoMethodA(APTR obj, struct opMember * msg);

    FUNCTION
	This method tells a model to remove an object from its
	broadcast list.

    INPUTS
	obj - modelclass object pointer
	msg - pointer to fully initialized struct opMember
	      (see <intuition/classusr.h>)

    RESULT
	The return value is not explicitly defined.

    SEE ALSO
	OM_ADDMEMBER, rootclass/OM_REMMEMBER

modelclass/OM_UPDATE                                         modelclass/OM_UPDATE

    NAME
	OM_UPDATE -- Update all modelclass members.

    SYNOPSIS
	uint32 result = IDoMethodA(APTR obj, struct opUpdate * msg);

    FUNCTION
	This method forwards the OM_UPDATE message to all the objects in
	the modeclass object's broadcast list. The modelclass does not
	map the attributes in these OM_UPDATE messages. Because modelclass
	inherits behavior from icclass, if the model has an ICA_TARGET and
	ICA_MAP, it will also send a mapped OM_UPDATE message to its
	ICA_TARGET.

    INPUTS
	obj - modelclass object pointer
	msg - pointer to fully initialized struct opUpdate
	      (see <intuition/classusr.h>)

    RESULT
	The return value is not explicitly defined.
