BetterBalance.mcc/BetterBalance.mccBetterBalance.mcc/BetterBalance.mcc

   BetterBalance.mcc was originally developed by Maik Schreiber.
   This is a native reimplementation included with MUI5 for convenience.

   BetterBalance.mcc is a subclass of MUI's own Balance.mui class which allows
   the programmer to easily save and load all balance settings of a GUI.

   This is how you can save all balance object positions:

   - Use BetterBalance objects instead of normal MUI Balance objects whereever
     you want to save the position.
   - Provide a *unique* MUIA_ObjectID for each BetterBalance object.
   - Use MUIM_Application_Save to save and MUIM_Application_Load to load the
     positions (you could override MUIM_Window_Snapshot to do that).
     This should be done before a window is opened.
