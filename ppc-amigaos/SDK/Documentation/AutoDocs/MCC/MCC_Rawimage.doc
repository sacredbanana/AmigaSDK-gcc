   Rawimage.mcc was originally developed by Christian Rosentreter for MorphOS.
   This is a native reimplementation included in MUI5 for AmigaOS for
   convenience.

   Rawimage.mcc is a MUI custom class which offers an easy way to integrate
   fixed images (i.e. logos or symbols for buttons) into MUI GUIs. The images
   can be embedded directly into the program code.

   The base format (32bit ARGB) of the data structure is compatible with the
   MUI_AlphaData structure. This makes it possible to embed uncompressed images
   into the program source which in turn can be used directly with MUI5's
   \033A[0xaddr] escape sequence for text output.

   struct MUI_AlphaData
   {
       ULONG width;
       ULONG height;
       ULONG padding[2];
       ULONG data[0];
   };

   Embedding many images into the code will increase executable's size
   noticeably. It may even happen that the actual image data become larger than
   the programs code. This is why Rawimage.mcc supports compressed raw image.

   Compressed image data is NOT compatible with MUI_AlphaData. The two reserved
   padding words are used to specify the compression format and the compressed
   data size.

   struct MUI_RawimageData
   {
       ULONG ri_Width;
       ULONG ri_Height;
       ULONG ri_Format;
       ULONG ri_Size;
       ULONG ri_Data[0];
   };

   Setting the ri_Size field is optional when ri_Format is 0.

   The raw image data for the embedded image can be constructed with one of the
   available tools, i.e. png2c, dt2raw, bin2c, dt2rawimage, etc. Refer to the
   source code of the EmbeddedImages demo how to use the different compression
   formats.

   Proceed as follows to construct a bzip2 compressed embedded image:
   > dt2raw logo.png logo.raw
   > bzip2 -k logo.raw
   > bin2c logo.raw logo.c

   The constructed data array must to be prefixed with the MUIA_RawimageData
   structure header like this:

   const char bz2_image[] = {
       0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x30, /* Width of logo.png:     48         */
       0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x30, /* Height of logo.png:    48         */
       'B',  'Z',  '2',  '\0', /* Format:                ARGB BZ2   */
       0x00, 0x00, 0x07, 0xf0, /* logo.png.bz2 filesize: 2032 Bytes */
       (compressed raw data follows here)

   NAME
   MUIA_Rawimage_Data -- [ISG], struct MUI_RawimageData *

   FUNCTION
   Create a new graphic for the RawimageObject. A pointer to valid MUI_AlphaData
   or MUI_RawimageData must to be specified.

   EXAMPLE
   ULONG rgbdata[] =
   {
       0x00000002, /* width */
       0x00000002, /* height */
       0x00000000, /* no compression */
       0x00000000  /* data size, irrelevant for this uncompressed image */
       0xffff0000, 0xff00ff00,
       0xff0000ff, 0xffffffff
   };

   set(obj, MUIA_Rawimage_Data, rgbdata);
