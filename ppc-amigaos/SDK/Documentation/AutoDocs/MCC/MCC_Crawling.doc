   Crawling.mcc was originally developed by Klaus Melchior.
   This is a native reimplementation included with MUI5 for convenience.

   Crawling.mcc is a subclass of MUIC_Virtgroup but with timed vertical
   scrolling. It will start to scroll the content after approx. 10 seconds and
   then repeatingly restart the scrolling again again after approx. 30 seconds.

   To use Crawling.mcc you create it like any other VirtGroup object. To avoid
   jumping from the last object back to the first object in the group these two
   objects should be identical and in the best case have exactly the same height
   as your Crawling object.

           [ ... insert all your information objects here ... ]

           /*
            * add a clone of the topmost object for smooth scrolling
            */
