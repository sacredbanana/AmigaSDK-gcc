    NAME
	sysiclass -- image class of scalable images

    SUPERCLASS
	imageclass

    REQUIRES
	frameiclass

    DESCRIPTION
	This is a class of system images and standard application images.
	As of Intuition version 51 there are 34 possible sysiclass image
	glyphs to choose from.

	The class caches the image's bitmap to improve rendering speed.

    RENDERING HOOK INTERFACE

	Starting with Intuition V50, sysiclass supports custom rendering
	hooks. The rendering hook message structure is defined in
	<intuition/plugins.h>. The object is a struct Image *
	(the image instance to be drawn). Please note that the object may
	be NULL in which case the rm_Flags field will hold information on
	what to render (see flags defined in <intuition/sysiclass.h>).

	The different types of messages that a sysiclass rendering
	hook can see can be found in the <intuition/sysiclass.h> file.
	More might be added in future Intuition releases.

	NOTE WELL: In a pen shade level map you render with colors 0-4
	which correspond to the LEVEL_#? constants defined in
	<intuition/gui.h>. In an alpha shading map, you render with
	colors 0-255 which are interpreted as alpha intensity percentages
	(darkest to brightest). The former method allows to produce 3D
	effects consistent with the user contrast settings for the GUI;
	the latter allows for fancy/artistic 3D rendering but can only
	be used on hicolor/truecolor screenmodes.

    STYLE PLUGIN INTERFACE

	A sysiclass plugin can export graphic styles for system imagery
	(in the form of a rendering hook and/or an array of struct
	VectorInfo) as well as geometry information for system gadgets
	and images (in the form of a geometry hook). As of V50, the
	style and geometry categories known by sysiclass are the
	following:
	  SC_GLOBALSTYLE      Default (fallback) graphic style
	  SC_GLOBALGEOMETRY   Default (fallback) geometry
	  SC_WINBORDERSTYLE   Style for window borders
	  SC_WINBFRAMESTYLE   Style for border gadget frames
	  SC_WINBGADSTYLE     Style for border gadget symbols
	  SC_GADGETSTYLE      Style for generic gadget symbols
	  SC_ARROWGSTYLE      Style for arrow gadget symbols
	  SC_CYCLEGSTYLE      Style for cycle gadget symbols
	  SC_KHANDLESTYLE     Style for knob handle symbols
	  SC_MENUSTYLE        Style for menu images
	  SC_WINBGADGEOMETRY  Geometry for border gadgets
	  SC_GADGETGEOMETRY   Geometry for inner gadgets

	Each plugin can export one or more sub-styles for each
	of the above style categories. It informs clients about
	this by initializing its SubStyles field: it must point
	to an array of struct SubStyle each of which represents
	a specific sub-style for a given category and gives its
	name and unique ID number (uniqueness only needs to be
	relative to the plugin and category). The array must be
	terminated by a NULL Name field.

	Specialized categories should contain at least all the
	sub-styles of their parent category. The style category
	hierarchy (as of V50) is as follows:

	+--SC_GLOBALSTYLE
	|  |
	|  +--SC_WINBORDERSTYLE
	|  +--SC_WINBFRAMESTYLE
	|  +--SC_WINBGADSTYLE
	|  +--SC_MENUSTYLE
	|  +--SC_GADGETSTYLE
	|     |
	|     +--SC_ARROWGSTYLE
	|     +--SC_CYCLEGSTYLE
	|     +--SC_KHANDLESTYLE
	|
	+--SC_GLOBALGEOMETRY
	   |
	   +--SC_WINBGADGEOMETRY
	   +--SC_GADGETGEOMETRY

	The main structure exported by a style plugin library
	is the SysIPlugin structure which is described in
	<intuition/sysiclass.h>.

	GEOMETRY HOOK INTERFACE

	Intuition may will call the geometry hook to determine
	the position and size of the specified object. More
	information about this interface is available in the
	<intuition/sysiclass.h> file.

    METHODS
	OM_NEW -- Create the sysiclass object. Passed to superclass first.

	OM_DISPOSE -- Destroy the object and then pass to superclass.

	OM_GET -- Get value of an attribute. Passed to superclass first.

	OM_SET -- Set object attributes. Passed to superclass first.

	IM_DRAW -- Draw sysiclass image with state.

	IM_DRAWFRAME -- Draw sysiclass image within limits.

	IM_EXTENT -- Inquire about rendering extent.

	IM_EXTENTFRAME -- Inquire about rendering extent with dimensions.

	IM_HITTEST -- Determine if image was hit in a title bar or pass
	              to the superclass.

	All other methods are passed to the superclass.

    ATTRIBUTES
	IA_Left (int16)

	    Defaults to DEPTHIMAGE.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_GET)

	SYSIA_DrawInfo (struct DrawInfo *)
	    This attribute contains a pointer to a DrawInfo structure
	    (defined in <intuition/screens.h>) describing the target
	    screen. The class requires this attribute in order to generate
	    the image into a bitmap cache.

	    Defaults to NULL.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET)

	SYSIA_ReferenceFont (struct TextFont *)
	    Font to use as reference for scaling certain sysiclass
	    images. This attribute will override any SYSIA_Size
	    provided to provide a scaled image proportional to the
	    reference font.

	    Defaults to NULL.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_GET)

	SYSIA_Size (uint32)
	    This attribute identifies which image size to use for the
	    object. This generalizes Intuition's older concept of two
	    different system image dimensions. There are three
	    possible values for this attribute:

	    SYSISIZE_MEDRES for Hires non-interlaced 640x200/256
	    SYSISIZE_HIRES  for Hires interlaced 640x400/512
	    SYSISIZE_LOWRES for Lores 320x200/256

	    These sizes do not apply to all of the glyphs consistently.
	    See the chart below for image dimensions (width x height)
	    according to the SYSIA_Size and the glyph category.

	    CATEGORY       LOWRES      MEDRES      HIRES
	    --------       ------      ------      -----
	    Title Bar      18 x 11     24 x 11     30 x 11
	    Window Border  13 x 13     18 x 18     22 x 22
	    CHECKIMAGE     26 x 11     26 x 11     26 x 11
	    MXIMAGE        17 x 9      17 x 9      17 x 9
	    CYCLEIMAGE     22 x 14     22 x 18     22 x 24
	    Gadget         14 x 14     18 x 18     24 x 24
	    AMIGAKEY       14 x 8      23 x 8      23 x 8
	    MENUSUB         6 x 6       8 x 8      12 x 12
	    Menu            9 x 8      15 x 8      20 x 8
	    Default        12 x 12     16 x 16     20 x 20

	    Use SYSIA_ReferenceFont instead for a more consistent
	    look relative to the size of the font.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_GET)

	SYSIA_BitMapCache (uint32)
	    Level of bitmap caching for sysiclass images. (V50)
	      0 = None
	      1 = Deferred
	      2 = Immediate

	    Defaults to 2 (immediate).

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET)

	SYSIA_FullFrame (BOOL)
	    Specifies whether the sysiclass image must have an
	    inner frame (if the current style normally has one).
	    This is useful only with TBFRAMEIMAGE images.

	    Set this to FALSE to get an image suitable as background
	    for text or TRUE if you want a normal titlebar gadget
	    image which you can add graphic contents to. (V50)

	    Defaults to FALSE.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_GET)

	SYSIA_Label (CONST_STRPTR)
	    Pointer to a string to be used as the image's text
	    label (if it supports one). For example, TBFRAMEIMAGE.
	    (V50)

	    Defaults to NULL.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_GET)

	SYSIA_ContentsBox (struct IBox *)
	    Inquire about the position and size of the inner area
	    of a TBFRAMEIMAGE image in order to bound your custom
	    imagery inside that area and avoid overwriting the image's
	    borders. (V50)

	    Applicability is (OM_GET)
