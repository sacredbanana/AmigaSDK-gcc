    NAME
	diffviewgclass -- For displaying file differences side-by-side

    SUPERCLASS
	gadgetclass

    REQUIRES
	nothing

    DESCRIPTION
	This gadget provides a graphical diff view of two files. You can provide
	an original (old) and modified (new) file, and let the gadget perform the
	diff operation internally, or you can pass either the old or new file along
	with a diff in the unified diff format if you wish to use a different
	diff algorythm.

	Currently the diff is a very simple line-based comparison.

    METHODS
	OM_NEW -- Create the diffview gadget. Passed to superclass.

	OM_SET -- Set object attributes. Passed to superclass.

	OM_DISPOSE -- Disposes object and then passed to superclass.

	OM_UPDATE -- Update object attributes. Passed to superclass first.

	OM_GET -- Obtain the value of an attribute.

	GM_RENDER -- Overrides superclass, renders the gadget imagery.

	GM_GOACTIVE -- Handles activation. Passed to superclass first.

	GM_HANDLEINPUT -- Handles all input.

	GM_GOINACTIVE -- Deactivates input. Passed to superclass first.

	GM_DOMAIN -- Passed to superclass.

	GM_CLIPRECT -- Passed to superclass.

	GM_LAYOUT -- Passed to superclass.

	GM_EXTENT -- Reports gadget rendering extent.

	All other methods are passed to the superclass.

    ATTRIBUTES

	GA_ReadOnly (BOOL)

	DIFFVIEW_CurrentLine (int32)
	    This tag sets the "current line" of the gadget. The current line
	    is highlighted with a border. If the diffview gadget has an
	    associated line-compare gadget, it will automatically be updated
	    to reflect the new current line. The tag is in the range 1..n.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_UPDATE, OM_GET)

	DIFFVIEW_DiffObject (APTR)
	    Before you can display a diff of two files, you need to create
	    a DiffObject with CreateDiffObject(). The DiffObject is a private
	    structure that represents a parsed diff of two files. See the
	    documentation for CreateDiffObject().

	    NOTE: If you dispose of a diffview gadget with a DiffObject attached,
	    the DiffObject will NOT be automatically de-allocated, and you must
	    still do so with FreeDiffObject().

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_UPDATE, OM_GET)

	DIFFVIEW_Font (struct TextFont *)
	    This allows you to specify a font to use with the gadget. You must
	    use a fixed-width font.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET)

	DIFFVIEW_HorizScroller (Object *)
	    Specifies the horizontal scroller.gadget being used to drive the
	    diffview.gadget's view area. This is a quick and easy way to link
	    to a scroller. Only scroller.gadget objects are supported using this
	    tag.

	    Note that the scroller.gadget object is only referenced and will not
	    be disposed of automatically.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET)

	DIFFVIEW_LineCmp (Object *)
	    Specifies a line-compare gadget to be associated with the diffview
	    gadget. This gadget will show the old and new versions of the
	    current line so that they can be compared in detail. You can obtain
	    a pointer to the linecmp class through IDiffView->LINECMP_GetClass()

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET)

	DIFFVIEW_Screen (struct Screen *)
	    This specifies the screen that the gadget will be used on. If you
	    are not using the default public screen for your GUI, you need to
	    specify this. You can change it without disposing of the gadget
	    if you move the GUI to another screen at a later time.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET)

	DIFFVIEW_TabSize (uint32)
	    Sets the tab size.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_UPDATE, OM_GET)

	DIFFVIEW_VertScroller (Object *)
	    Specifies the vertical scroller.gadget being used to drive the
	    diffview.gadget's view area. This is a quick and easy way to link
	    to a scroller. Only scroller.gadget objects are supported using this
	    tag.

	    Note that the scroller.gadget object is only referenced and will not
	    be disposed of automatically.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET)

	DIFFVIEW_ViewOffsetTop (uint32)
	    Sets the line to show at the top of the diffview.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_UPDATE, OM_GET)

	DIFFVIEW_ViewOffsetLeft (uint32)
	    Sets the column to show at the left edge of the diffview.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_UPDATE, OM_GET)

	The following tags allow you to customise the colours used by the
	gadget. If you don't use them, a default colour scheme will be used.
	The tag values for these colours are 24bit RGB (0x00RRGGBB). The upper 8
	bits are ignored. On screens with 15bit depth or higher, no pens will be
	used by the gadget. On screens with less than 15bit depth, the intuition
	pen sharing scheme will be used.

	DIFFVIEW_BackCol (uint32)
	DIFFVIEW_TextCol (uint32)
	    These tags set the background and text colours of the text areas of
	    the gadget.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET)

	DIFFVIEW_OldCol (uint32)
	DIFFVIEW_NewCol (uint32)
	    These tags set the background colours for lines that only appear in
	    the old and new files, respectively.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET)

	DIFFVIEW_BlankCol (uint32)
	    This tag sets the colour used to draw a pattern over blank lines.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET)

	DIFFVIEW_LineNoBackCol (uint32)
	DIFFVIEW_LineNoTextCol (uint32)
	    These tags describe the background and text colour of the line
	    line numbers.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET)

	DIFFVIEW_GeneralBackCol (uint32)
	DIFFVIEW_GeneralShineCol (uint32)
	DIFFVIEW_GeneralShadowCol (uint32)
	    These tags set the background for non-text areas, and the shine and
	    shadow colours used for bevels in the gadget.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET)

	DIFFVIEW_OverviewOldCol (uint32)
	DIFFVIEW_OverviewNewCol (uint32)
	    These tags set the colours for the modified lines in the overview
	    part of the gadget.

	DIFFVIEW_WsDifferenceCol (uint32)
	    This tag sets the colour for lines that differ only by whitespace

	DIFFVIEW_OverviewWsCol (uint32)
	    This tag sets the colour for lines that differ only by whitespace in
	    the overview part of the gadget.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET)

    DESCRIPTION
	As well as the main side-by-side diff view, diffview.gadget implements a
	supplementary gadget designed to show two versions of a line one above the
	other so that the exact differences can be easily seen. It is designed to
	be shown above or below a diffview gadget to allow a line to be examined
	closely. It is not meant to be used independantly, and most of its
	functionality can be automatically controlled by a diffview gadget.

	OM_SET -- Set object attributes. Passed to superclass.

	OM_DISPOSE -- Disposes object and then passed to superclass.

	OM_UPDATE -- Update object attributes. Passed to superclass first.

	OM_GET -- Obtain the value of an attribute.

	GM_RENDER -- Overrides superclass, renders the gadget imagery.

	GM_GOACTIVE -- Handles activation. Passed to superclass first.

	GM_HANDLEINPUT -- Always returns GMR_REUSE.

	GM_GOINACTIVE -- Deactivates input. Passed to superclass first.

	GM_DOMAIN -- Passed to superclass then GDOMAIN_MINIMUM is handled.

	GM_CLIPRECT -- Passed to superclass.

	GM_LAYOUT -- Passed to superclass.

	GM_EXTENT -- Reports gadget rendering extent.

	All other methods are passed to the superclass.

   NAME
      CreateDiffObject -- Creates a difference object.

   SYNOPSIS
      APTR CreateDiffObject(struct TagItem *tags);
      APTR CreateDiffObjectTags(Tag Tag1, ...);

   FUNCTION
      This function takes two input files and generates a private parsed diff
      that you then pass to the gadget when you want to display it. You can
      pass in an original and modified file if you want diffview.gadget to
      use its own internal diff algorythm, or you can pass one file and a
      unified diff format. There is no need to pass both files and a diff,
      if a diff is passed, only one of the files will be used.

      Currently diffview.gadget only deals with files that have been
      completely loaded into memory.

   TAGS
      DIFFOBJECT_OldFile (STRPTR)
      DIFFOBJECT_OldFileLen (uint32)
          These tags describe a memory buffer containing the original file.
          It will appear on the left side of the diffview. You have to pass
          both a buffer pointer and length at the same time, or these tags
          will be ignored. Once the DiffObject has been successfully created,
          you can free the original buffer, as it is not used by the gadget
          directly.

      DIFFOBJECT_NewFile (STRPTR)
      DIFFOBJECT_NewFileLen (uint32)
          These tags describe a memory buffer containing the modified file.
          It will appear on the right side of the diffview. You have to pass
          both a buffer pointer and length at the same time, or these tags
          will be ignored. Once the DiffObject has been successfully created,
          you can free the original buffer, as it is not used by the gadget
          directly.

      DIFFOBJECT_Diffs (STRPTR)
      DIFFOBJECT_DiffsLen (uint32)
          These tags describe a memory buffer containing a diff in the
          unified diff format. If you use this buffer, you only need to
          specify an original (old) or modified (new) buffer, but not both,
          since the diff describes how to create one from the other. Once the
          DiffObject has been successfully created, you can free the original
          buffer, as it is not used by the gadget directly.

      DIFFOBJECT_ErrorStr (STRPTR *)
          If the call fails, the pointer you specify here will be modified to
          point to a human-readable error string.

      DIFFOBJECT_ErrorNum (uint32 *)
          If the call fails, the uint32 variable you pass a pointer to here
          will be set to an error value. These errors are defined in
          gadgets/diffview.h

      DIFFOBJECT_OldFileName (STRPTR)
      DIFFOBJECT_NewFileName (STRPTR)
          These tags allow you to specify the names to put at the top of the
          respective columns. They are cached internally by the gadget, so
          you can free or re-use the buffers without causing a problem.

      DIFFOBJECT_WsUnimportant (BOOL)
          When TRUE, lines that differ only in whitespace will be considered
          as equal (although they will be highlighted in a seperate colour).
          When FALSE, such lines will be considered different. This tag only
          has any effect when you are passing an old and new file to compare.
          Defaults to TRUE

      DIFFOBJECT_ProgressCB (DIFFOBJPROGCB)
          If specified, this is a callback that will be called while
          comparing files. It gets called for every 1% of progress. The first
          parameter to the callback is the progress percentage. The second is
          a userdata pointer passed in with DIFFOBJECT_ProgCBData.

      DIFFOBJECT_ProgCBData (APTR)
          The userdata for the progress callback. Defaults to NULL.

   RESULT
       A non-null pointer to be passed to a diffview object, or NULL for
       failure.

   NAME
      FreeDiffObject -- Frees a previously allocated diffobject

   SYNOPSIS
      void FreeDiffObject(APTR DiffObj);

   FUNCTION
      This function frees a DiffObject previously allocated with
      CreateDiffObject. You must not free a DiffObject that is still in use
      by a diffview object.

   INPUTS
      DiffObj - A DiffObject pointer returned from a previous call to
                CreateDiffObject

   NAME
       GetDiffObjectAttr

   SYNOPSIS
       APTR GetDiffObjectAttr(APTR DiffObject, uint32 Attr, APTR Storage)

   FUNCTION
       This function is used to query a DiffObject created by
       CreateDiffObject for a specific attribute.

   INPUTS
       DiffObject - A DiffObject pointer returned from CreateDiffObject
       Attr       - The attribute to get
       Storage    - A pointer to the place to store the attribute. The actual
                    item stored depends on the attribute.
   ATTRIBUTES
       DIFFOBJECT_DiffPositions (struct DiffPosition *)
           This returns returns a pointer to a "struct DiffPosition" which
           contains an array of positions of the differences between the
           files. These positions are in the range 1..n, so that they can be
           used with DIFFVIEW_CurrentLine. When you are finished with it,
           you must free it with FreeVec().

   RESULT
       TRUE if the attribute could be obtained, or FALSE otherwise
