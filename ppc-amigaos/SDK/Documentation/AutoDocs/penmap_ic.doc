    NAME
	penmap.image -- Create penmap BOOPSI objects

    SUPERCLASS
	imageclass

    DESCRIPTION
	This class will yield color remapped images on any public screen.
	It also supports bitmap scaling. If used with V39 or or greater
	of AmigaOS it can take advantage of pen sharing.

    METHODS
	OM_NEW -- Create the penmap image. Passed to superclass then OM_SET.

	OM_DISPOSE -- Delete the penmap image.

	OM_GET -- Get object attributes. Passed to superclass first.

	OM_SET -- Set object attributes. Passed to superclass first.

	OM_UPDATE -- Set object notification attributes.
	             Passed to superclass first.

	IM_DRAW -- Renders the image. Supports IDS_NORMAL and IDS_SELECTED
	           drawing states and does not require a DrawInfo structure.
	           Uses BitMapScale() function to scale the image if required.

	IM_DRAWFRAME -- Renders the image scaled to the frame size specified.
	                Supports IDS_NORMAL and IDS_SELECTED drawing states
	                and does not require a DrawInfo structure. Uses
	                BitMapScale() function to scale the image if required.

	IM_ERASE -- Erase the image.

	IM_ERASEFRAME -- Erase the image using the frame size.

	IM_DOMAINFRAME -- Query the domain frame size.

	All other methods are passed to the superclass.

    ATTRIBUTES
	IA_Width (int16)
	IA_Height (int16)
	    Set size of the image, scaling via BitMapScale() if different
	    from the chunky image data size.

	    Defaults to width and height of IA_Data.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_UPDATE, OM_GET)

	IA_BGPen (uint8)
	    Specify background pen of a normal image.

	    Defaults to BACKGROUNDPEN of the screen passed in PENMAP_Screen.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_UPDATE, OM_GET)

	IA_Pens (uint16 *)
	    Sets the pens which the values in the data array represents.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_UPDATE, OM_GET)

	IA_Data (uint8 *)
	    Chunky format image data for normal render.

	    The data format is a uint8 array of chunky pen numbers.
	    Note this data must be uint16 aligned as the first 4 bytes
	    are accessed as two uint16's which specify the width and
	    height of the following chunky image data.

	    Defaults to NULL.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_UPDATE, OM_GET)

	PENMAP_SelectData (uint8 *)
	    Chunky format image data for selected image render.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_UPDATE, OM_GET)

	PENMAP_Palette (uint32 *)
	    An array of uint32 describing the palette for the picture.
	    If you are obtaining pens yourself, you should only pass the
	    IA_Pens attribute at object creation time.

	    The format of the array is:

	    uint32 palette[] =
	    {
	        number_triplets,
	        red1, green1, blue1,
	        red2, green2, blue2,
	        ...
	    };

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_UPDATE, OM_GET)

	PENMAP_Screen (struct Screen *)
	    Pointer to the screen to use image on. This attribute must
	    be provided when creating an object of this class.

	    Defaults to NULL.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_UPDATE, OM_GET)

	PENMAP_Transparent (BOOL)
	    Remaps chunky pen 0 to the BACKGROUNDPEN.

	    Defaults to FALSE.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET)

	PENMAP_Precision (int16)
	    Set the precision for ObtainBestPen() when penmap is used
	    under AmigaOS 3.0 or later. See the ObtainBestPen autodoc
	    for more details.

	    Defaults to PRECISION_IMAGE.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET)

	PENMAP_ColorMap (struct ColorMap *)
	    Pointer to a colormap to use in obtaining best matching pens.
	    This tag or PENMAP_Screen must be provided when creating an
	    object of this class. If PENMAP_Screen is passed, penmap will
	    use Screen->ViewPort.ColorMap.

	    Defaults to NULL.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_UPDATE)

	PENMAP_MaskBlit (BOOL)
	    Causes penmap to render on screen using a mask plane. This
	    mask plane is created dynamically by the class.

	    The mask is created by OR'ing the source bitplanes into a single
	    mask plane using some nifty blitting techniques. This tag should
	    be used if penmap objects are used in a layout group that may
	    contain a user or program specified backfill. This will allow the
	    backfill pattern to flow around the image, making it transparent.

	    Defaults to FALSE.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET)

	PENMAP_MaskPlane (uint8 *) (V53.3)
	    Retrieves the mask plane generated when PENMAP_MaskBlit is TRUE.
	    If no mask is in use then this attribute is NULL.

	    Applicability is (OM_GET)

	PENMAP_SelectMaskPlane (uint8 *) (V53.3)
	    Retrieves the select mask plane generated when PENMAP_MaskBlit
	    is TRUE. If no mask is in use then this attribute is NULL.

	    Applicability is (OM_GET)

	PENMAP_Compressed (uint32) (V50)
	    The compression type used in the image data.
	    Supported values are cmpNone and cmpByteRun1.

	    Defaults to cmpNone.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET)
