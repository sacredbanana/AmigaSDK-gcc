    NAME
	groupgclass -- gadget group class

    SUPERCLASS
	gadgetclass

    REQUIRES
	None

    DESCRIPTION
	This is a class of objects that maintains an internal list of
	gadgets. Its purpose is to make it easier to layout a group of
	gadgets. Any gadgets that are a member of a groupgclass object
	are rendered relative to the groupgclass object's GA_Left and
	GA_Top attributes. As new gadgets are added to the groupgclass
	object the groupgclass object's dimensions grow to enclose the
	new gadgets. When the groupgclass object receives an OM_DISPOSE
	message, it not only disposes of itself, it also disposes of all
	the gadgets in its list. Groupgclass does not support the gadget
	relative flags (GA_RelWidth, GA_RelHeight, GA_RelBottom and
	GA_RelRight).

    METHODS
	OM_NEW -- Create the groupgclass object. Passed to superclass.

	OM_DISPOSE -- Destroy the gadget and then pass to superclass.

	OM_SET -- Set object attributes. Passed to superclass first.

	OM_ADDMEMBER -- Add an object to the group.

	OM_REMMEMBER -- Remove an object from the group.

	GM_HITTEST -- Determine if some gadget was hit.

	GM_RENDER -- Render all the gadgets in the group.

	GM_GOACTIVE -- Activate the gadget that was hit.

	GM_GOINACTIVE -- Deactivate the active gadget.

	GM_HANDLEINPUT -- Active gadget handles the input.

	All other methods are passed to the superclass.

    ATTRIBUTES
	GA_Left (int16)
	GA_Top (int16)
	    These attributes correspond to the embedded Gadget.LeftEdge and
	    Gadget.TopEdge fields. Setting these attributes in groupgclass
	    object causes it to change its position as well as the position
	    of each of the gadgets that have been added to the group gadget.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_GET, OM_UPDATE)

groupgclass/GM_HITTEST                                     groupgclass/GM_HITTEST

    NAME
	GM_HITTEST -- Determine if some gadget was hit.

    SYNOPSIS
	uint32 result = IDoMethodA(APTR obj, struct gpHitTest* msg);

    FUNCTION
	This method works its way through the list of group members,
	sending each a GM_HITTEST message, looking for the first member
	in the list that says it has been hit. This member gadget then
	becomes the active member.

    INPUTS
	obj - gadget object pointer
	msg - pointer to fully initialized struct gpHitTest
	      (see <intuition/gadgetclass.h>)

    RESULT
	The return value is GMR_GADGETHIT if hit or 0 otherwise.

groupgclass/OM_ADDMEMBER                                 groupgclass/OM_ADDMEMBER

    NAME
	OM_ADDMEMBER -- Add an object to the group.

    SYNOPSIS
	uint32 result = IDoMethodA(APTR obj, struct opMember * msg);

    FUNCTION
	This method adds a gadget to the group object's list. The group
	object will increase the size of its select box to include the
	new gadget's select box. The group object moves the new member
	to an absolute location (by changing the new member's GA_Left and
	GA_Top attributes) relative to the group object's upper-left corner.
	Note that all members of the groupgclass object will be deleted
	by OM_DISPOSE.

    INPUTS
	obj - object pointer
	msg - pointer to fully initialized struct opMember
	      (see <intuition/classusr.h>)

    RESULT
	Always returns 1.

    SEE ALSO
	OM_REMMEMBER, OM_DISPOSE, intuition.library/DoGadgetMethod()

groupgclass/OM_REMMEMBER                                 groupgclass/OM_REMMEMBER

    NAME
	OM_REMMEMBER -- Remove an object from the group.

    SYNOPSIS
	uint32 result = IDoMethodA(APTR obj, struct opMember * msg);

    FUNCTION
	This method removes a gadget added to the group object's list
	with OM_ADDMEMBER. Note that all members of the groupgclass
	object will be deleted by OM_DISPOSE.

    INPUTS
	obj - object pointer
	msg - pointer to fully initialized struct opMember
	      (see <intuition/classusr.h>)

    RESULT
	Always returns 1.

    SEE ALSO
	OM_ADDMEMBER, OM_DISPOSE, intuition.library/DoGadgetMethod()

groupgclass/OM_SET                                             groupgclass/OM_SET

    NAME
	OM_SET -- Set object attributes.

    SYNOPSIS
	uint32 result = IDoMethodA(APTR obj, struct omSet * msg);

    FUNCTION
	This method passes most attributes to the superclass but
	propagates changes in position to its members appropriately.
	Also, GA_Width and GA_Height are calculated from the position
	and dimension of the membership.

    INPUTS
	obj - gadget object pointer
	msg - pointer to fully initialized struct opSet
	      (see <intuition/classusr.h>)

    RESULT
	Returns zero if refreshed successfully or non-zero if not.

    SEE ALSO
	rootclass/OM_SET

groupglcass/OM_DISPOSE                                     groupglcass/OM_DISPOSE

    NAME
	OM_DISPOSE -- Destroy the gadget.

    SYNOPSIS
	uint32 result = IDoMethodA(APTR rootobj, Msg msg);

    FUNCTION
	This method disposes of the groupgclass object and all its
	member gadgets.

    INPUTS
	obj - gadget object pointer
	msg - Msg with MethodID = OM_DISPOSE
	      (see <intuition/classusr.h>)

    RESULT
	The return value is not explicitly defined.
