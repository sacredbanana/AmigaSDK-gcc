    NAME
	scrollergclass -- scroller gadget class

    SUPERCLASS
	gadgetclass

    REQUIRES
	propgclass, buttongclass, sysiclass

    DESCRIPTION
	The scrollergclass class enhances the propgclass class object but
	does not derive from it. Scrollergclass objects support both
	absolute and relative coordinates. Additionally, arrow buttons
	are supported which will change the position of the knob by a
	configurable delta value.

    METHODS
	OM_NEW -- Create the scrollergclass object. Passed to superclass.

	OM_DISPOSE -- Destroy the gadget and then pass to superclass.

	OM_GET -- Obtain the value of an attribute. Passed to superclass.

	OM_SET -- Set object attributes. Passed to superclass.

	OM_UPDATE -- Update object attributes. Passed to superclass.

	GM_RENDER -- Render the gadget with state. Passed to image class.

	GM_GOACTIVE -- Activate the gadget.

	GM_GOINACTIVE -- Deactivate the gadget.

	GM_HANDLEINPUT -- Handle input while active.

	GM_LAYOUT -- Calculate relative gadget coordinates.

	GM_EXTENT -- Inquire about rendering extent.

	All other methods are passed to the superclass.

    ATTRIBUTES
	PGA_Freedom (uint16)
	    This attribute tells a scrollergclass object on which axis
	    the gadget's knob is free to move (horizontal or vertical).
	    It is either FREEHORIZ or FREEVERT.

	    Defaults to FREEVERT.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW)

	PGA_Top (uint32)
	PGA_Total (uint32)
	PGA_Visible (uint32)
	    These attributes are based on the use of proportional
	    gadgets to control scrolling text. When scrolling 100 lines
	    of text in a 25 line visible window, you would set
	    PGA_Total to 100, PGA_Visible to 25, and watch PGA_Top run
	    from 0 to 75 (top line of the last page).

	    If the user clicks in the scroller gadget but not on the
	    knob, the entire knob jumps one "page" (the size of the
	    visible area minus one, PGA_Visible-1). The page jump will
	    leave an overlap of one line unless the value PGA_Visible
	    is 1 in which case the gadget acts as an integer numeric
	    slider sliding from 0 to PGA_Total - 1.

	    When PGA_Top changes the gadget sends itself an OM_NOTIFY
	    message about this attribute change with the GA_ID and the
	    PGA_Top in the message attributes.

	    Defaults to PGA_Top 0, PGA_Total 1 and PGA_Visible 1.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_UPDATE, OM_GET)
	    PGA_Top is also (OM_NOTIFY)

	PGA_ArrowDelta (int32)
	    This attribute determines how much of a change the arrow
	    buttons will make when pressed. The delta value must be
	    greater than or equal to 1.

	    Defaults to 1.

	    Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_UPDATE)

	PGA_ArrowDown (BOOL)
	    This boolean attribute will be present in the OM_NOTIFY
	    messages sent by the scrollergclass object to itself while
	    the scroller is active. The receiver of any OM_UPDATE
	    messages can then determine if the event is the result
	    of an arrow button being pressed or not.

	    Applicability is (OM_NOTIFY)
