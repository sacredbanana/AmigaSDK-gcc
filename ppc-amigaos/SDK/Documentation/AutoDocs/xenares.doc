   NAME
      AllocResource -- Obtain exclusive access to Xena resources

   SYNOPSIS
      CONST_STRPTR AllocResource(uint32 unitNum, CONST_STRPTR name);

   FUNCTION
      This function attempts to allocate one of the resources provided
      by the Xena subsystem. If the resource has already been allocated,
      a STRPTR describing the user who has the resource is returned.

   INPUTS
       unitNum - one of:
           XR_XTAGPORT, The JTAG programming port used to program
             or debug the onboard XMOS chip and any additional XMOS
             chips attached by the Xorro card.

           XR_DATABUS, The LocalBus CPU interface attached to the
             onboard XMOS chip

           XR_INTERRUPT, The interrupt used to alert the CPU
             when Xena needs attention.

           XR_LONELYBIT, The extra, unassigned bit from Xena to
             the PLD.

       name - A string describing your app, to be provided to any
              who are denied access because you have not released
              a resource.

   RESULT
       NULL on success, pointer to resource holders name on failure.

   SYNOPSIS
      void FreeResource(uint32 unitNum);

   FUNCTION
      Releases exclusive access granted by AllocResource.

   INPUTS
       unitNum - One of:
           XR_XTAGPORT, The JTAG programming port used to program
             or debug the onboard XMOS chip and any additional XMOS
             chips attached by the Xorro card.

             when Xena needs attention.

           XR_LONELYBIT, The extra, unassigned bit from Xena to
             the PLD.

   RESULT
       This function does not return a result
