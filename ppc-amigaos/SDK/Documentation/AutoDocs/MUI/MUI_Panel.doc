    NAME
	MUIM_Panel_Run (V21) 0x8042d789

    SYNOPSIS
	DoMethod(obj, MUIM_Panel_Run, Object *app, Object *win);

    FUNCTION
	This method opens the panel window and eventually "runs" the panel
	asynchronously to the main MUI application in a separate process.

	If your panel needs some special setup then do that before passing the method to
	Panel class. Vice versa if your panel needs some special cleanup then do that
	after the method returns from Panel class.

    INPUTS
	Object *app
	     the application object to let the panel run asynchronously to the main
	     application.

	Object *win
	     the window object containing the panel object.

    NOTES
	If the window could be opened successfully by this method it will stay open
	afterwards, e.g. for inspection of its position and size.

    RESULT
	A boolean value indicating whether "running" the panel succeeded or not.
