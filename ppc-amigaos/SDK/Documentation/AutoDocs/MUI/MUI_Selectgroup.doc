	Selectgroup objects combine radio buttons and labels or other visible objects
	into a group of selectable options.

	Well known example are the selection for the type of list scrollbars in MUI
	prefs.

	To be acting as a group with fully clickable option items at least one object
	per option must have MUIA_UserData set to MUIA_Selectgroup_Active. Usually this
	is done for the Radio button, as this kind of object is able to display the
	active state by itself.

    EXAMPLE
	Object *selButton(void)
	{
	  return ImageObject,
	    MUIA_Image_Spec, MUII_RadioButton,
	    MUIA_Image_FontMatch, TRUE,
	    MUIA_ShowSelState, FALSE,
	    MUIA_InputMode, MUIV_InputMode_Immediate,
	    // this is the important information
	    MUIA_UserData, MUIA_Selectgroup_Active,
	  End;
	}

	// create a selection group with 3 options where the full entry (radio button
	// plus label) is clickable
	Object *selgroup;
	selgroup = MUI_NewObject(MUIC_Selectgroup,
	  MUIA_Group_Columns, 2,
	  Child, selButton(),
	  Child, MUI_MakeObject(MUIO_Label, "Option 1", MUIO_Label_LeftAligned),
	  Child, selButton(),
	  Child, MUI_MakeObject(MUIO_Label, "Option 2", MUIO_Label_LeftAligned),
	  Child, selButton(),
	  Child, MUI_MakeObject(MUIO_Label, "Option 3", MUIO_Label_LeftAligned),
	TAG_DONE);
