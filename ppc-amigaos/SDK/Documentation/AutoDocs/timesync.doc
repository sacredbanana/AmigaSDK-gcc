   NAME
	RemoteSyncA -- Get/set time from a remote timeserver.
	RemoteSync  -- Varargs stub for RemoteSyncA().

   SYNOPSIS
	uint32 result = RemoteSyncA( struct TagItem *TagList );
	uint32 result = RemoteSync( uint32 Tag1, ... );


   FUNCTION
	This function tries to retrieve time from a remote timeserver and is
	able to set system time and/or the hardware clock.

   INPUTS
	TagList = array of TagItem structures with attribute/value pairs.

   TAGS
	RS_PROTOCOL (UBYTE)
	  Specify which protocol should be used.
	  Currently only the Network Time Protocol (NTP) can be used by default.

	RS_SERVER (STRPTR)
	  Specifies the name of the remote server.
	  When set to 'PREFS' the time server specified from the Time prefs
	  editor will be used.

	RS_PORT (uint32)
	  Specify a port number >0 to be used when talking to the remote server.
	  Currently defaults to '123'.
	  When RS_SERVER is set to 'PREFS' the port number specified from the
	  Time prefs editor will be used.

	RS_UTCOFFSET (int32)
	  Specify the offset in seconds between local time and Coordinated
	  Universal Time (UTC, formerly referred to as "Greenwich Mean Time" GMT).
	  Defaults to using the offset from Timezone or Locale.
	  When RS_SERVER is set to 'PREFS' the UTC offset specified from the
	  Time prefs editor will be used.

	RS_SETSYSTIME (BOOL)
	  Set to TRUE when the current system time shall be changed to reflect
	  the time from the remote server.
	  Defaults to TRUE.

	RS_SAVETIME (BOOL)
	  Set to TRUE when the battery backed clock shall be changed to reflect
	  the time from the remote server.
	  Defaults to FALSE.

	RS_DIFFTIME (struct timeval *)
	  Specify a pointer to a timeval which will hold the difference between
	  current system time and the time from the remote server.
	  Defaults to NULL.

	RS_ERRNO (int32 *)
	  Specify a pointer to a uint32 which will contain a socket error code
	  if the time couldn't be retrieved successfully from the remote server.
	  Defaults to NULL.
	  Error codes are defined in <libraries/timesync.h>.

	RS_ERRBUFFER (STRPTR)  (Added 53.10)
	  Specify a pointer to a buffer for a copy of an error message, if the
	  time could not be retrieved successfully from the remote server.
	  This tag requires the buffer size be specified with RS_ERRBUFFERSIZE.
	  A buffer size of at least 100 bytes is recommended.
	  Defaults to NULL.

	RS_ERRBUFFERSIZE (uint32)  (Added 53.10)
	  Specify the size of the RS_ERRBUFFER buffer, (in bytes).
	  Defaults to 0.

   RESULTS
	result - TSERR_NONE or an error code from TSERR_INVALID to TSERR_FAIL.
	Error codes are defined in <libraries/timesync.h>.

   BUGS
	The RS_ERRSTR tag is obsolete from V53.10 due to misinterpretation of the
	docs by some apps and the incorrect implementation within this function,
	use RS_ERRBUFFER & RS_ERRBUFFERSIZE to retrieve an error message string.
