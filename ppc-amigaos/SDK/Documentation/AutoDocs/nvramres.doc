   NAME
      GetAmigaNV -- Copies contents of AmigaOS NVRAM to a given buffer

   SYNOPSIS
      valid = GetAmigaNV(buffer);
   
      ULONG GetAmigaNV(APTR buffer);

   FUNCTION
      Copies the contents of AmigaOS NVRAM to a given buffer. The size
      of the given buffer must be large enough to accomodate the copy.

      The required size of the buffer can be checked with
      GetAmigaSize().

   INPUTS
      buffer - A pointer to a previously allocated memory buffer

   RESULT
      The result of the get operation will be returned.

      Possible results are:

      OK_CRC_VALID - Read was succesful, and CRC32 was correct.

      OK_CRC_INVALID - Read was succesful, but CRC32 was incorrect.

      ERROR - Unspecified error was encountered reading from NVRAM.

   EXAMPLE
      if (GetAmigaNV(buffer) && OK_CRC_INVALID)
      {
         printf("Warning: NVRAM CRC invalid.\n"):
      }

   NOTES
      In the event that the CRC of the NVRAM contents is invalid,
      part of all the NVRAM contents may be corrupt. It may still
      be beneficial however to examine the NVRAM contents, so the
      contents will be returned regardless of CRC. It is the
      responsibility of the caller to verify the CRC by checking
      the return result.

      The first four bytes of the buffer are the CRC32, and should
      not be used.

   NAME
      GetAmigaSize -- Returns the size of the AmigaOS NVRAM in bytes.

   SYNOPSIS
      size = GetAmigaSize();
   
      ULONG GetAmigaSize(void)

   FUNCTION
      Returns the size (in bytes) of the NVRAM space that is assigned
      to AmigaOS. By definition it is currently 28 KB (28672 bytes).

   RESULT
      The size of NVRAM reserved in bytes, should be 28672.

   NOTES
      The size of NVRAM is set in the header <resources/nvram.h>.
      It can be modified to accomodate different configurations.

   NAME
      GetUBootNV -- Copies contents of UBoot NVRAM to a given buffer

   SYNOPSIS
      valid = GetUBootNV(buffer);
   
      ULONG GetUBootNV(APTR buffer);

   FUNCTION
      Copies the contents of UBoot NVRAM to a given buffer. The size
      of the given buffer must be large enough to accomodate the copy.

   INPUTS
      buffer - A pointer to a previously allocated memory buffer

   RESULT
      The result of the get operation will be returned.

      Possible results are:

      OK_CRC_VALID - Read was succesful, and CRC32 was correct.

      OK_CRC_INVALID - Read was succesful, but CRC32 was incorrect.

      ERROR - Unspecified error was encountered reading from NVRAM.

      if (GetUBootNV(buffer) && OK_CRC_INVALID)
      {
         printf("Warning: NVRAM CRC invalid.\n");

   NAME
      GetUBootSize -- Returns the size of the U-Boot NVRAM in bytes.

   SYNOPSIS
      size = GetUBootSize();
   
      ULONG GetUBootSize(void)

   FUNCTION
      Returns the size (in bytes) of the NVRAM space that is assigned
      to U-Boot. By definition it is currently 4 KB (4096 bytes).

   RESULT
      The size of NVRAM reserved in bytes, should be 4096. 

   NOTES
      The size of NVRAM is set in the header <resources/nvram.h>.
      It can be modified to accomodate different configuratioins.
      
      IMPORTANT: The first four bytes of NVRAM are always reserved for a 32 bit
      CRC (stored as an unsigned long). 
      The actual NVRAM available for use is (size - sizeof(ULONG)).

      NVRAM.

   SYNOPSIS
      result = PutAmigaNV(buffer);
   
      ULONG PutAmigaNV(const APTR buffer);

   FUNCTION
      Stores the contents of the given buffer to AmigaOS NVRAM.
      The size of the buffer should not exceed the result of
      GetAmigaSize(). Any data beyond this size, is ignored and
      will not be stored.

   INPUTS
       buffer - A pointer to a memory block with the contents that
       are to be stored in AmigaOS NVRAM.

   RESULT
       The result of the put operation will be returned.

       Possible results are:

       OK - Write was succesful.

       ERROR - Unspecified error was encountered writing to NVRAM.

   NOTES
      This is a low level function. The entire contents of NVRAM
      are wiped and replaced with the contents of the given buffer!
      
      The first four bytes of the given buffer must not be used,
      they will be replaced with the NVRAM CRC32 when stored.
