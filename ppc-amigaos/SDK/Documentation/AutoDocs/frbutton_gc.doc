    NAME
	frbuttonclass -- framed button gadget class

    SUPERCLASS
	buttongclass

    REQUIRES
	None

    DESCRIPTION
	This is a special class of buttongclass that puts a BOOPSI framing
	image around some other display element. This display element can
	be one of three things: plain text from the "GA_Text attribute,
	an IntuiText from the GA_IntuiText attribute or an Image from
	the GA_LabelImage attribute.

	The user activates the gadget by clicking within the bounds of the
	gadget's framing image which it gets from the GA_Image attribute.
	Usually the framing image is an instance of an image class that
	supports the IM_FRAMEBOX method (like frameiclass). If the framing
	image supports the IM_FRAMEBOX method the frbuttonclass object
	centers the frame image around the display element. See the
	imageclass description of IM_FRAMEBOX for more information.
