   NAME
	aux_handler -- a console handler for the serial port

   SYNOPSIS
	Open("AUX:[DEVICE=<name>/BAUD=<speed>/CONTROL=<settings>/
	      UNIT=<Unit number>]/FLOW={SOFTWARE|HARDWARE|NONE}",...);

   FUNCTION
	The AUX-Handler is a console handler which which uses the serial port
	rather than the Amiga screen or keyboard.

	Accessing "AUX:" connects AmigaDOS to the system's default serial
	port. Following AUX:, the baud rate and some control information can
	be supplied. This is done in the form "AUX:baud/control" where baud
	is a number indicating the baud rate, and where control is a 3 letter
	sequence denoting the number of read/write bits, the parity, and the
	number of stop bits. For example, "AUX:9600/8N1" connects to the
	serial port, sets the baud rate to 9600, with 8 bit data, no parity,
	and 1 stop bit. The possible control settings are:

	     1st character: 7 or 8
	     2nd character: N (No parity), O (Odd parity), E (Even parity)
	                    M (Mark parity), S (Space parity)
	     3rd character: 1 or 2

	To override the flow control settings, use the FLOW parameter with
	the options "SOFT" or "SOFTWARE" for xON/xOFF software flow control,
	"HARD", "HARDWARE" or "7WIRE" for 7-wire hardware flow control,
	or "NONE" for no flow control.

	Specifying no baud rate, flow or control values when accessing AUX:
	gives you the values set in Serial preferences, or the default
	settings for the respective serial device driver.

	To override the default unit number, use the UNIT keyword. For
	example, to access unit 1 with 38400 bps you could use
	"AUX:38400/UNIT=1".

   MOUNTLIST ENTRIES
	Starting with V50, you can provide disk-based mount entries which let
	you use AUX-Handler on various devices and units. The form of these
	mount entries is:

	   AUX0: EHandler  = L:AUX-Handler
	         Priority  = 5
	         StackSize = 1000
	         GlobVec   = -1
	         Device    = serial.device
	         Unit      = 0
	         Flags     = 0
	         Control   = "8N1"
	         Baud      = 9600
	   #

	The "Device", "Unit" and "Flags" keywords define the parameters that
	the handler uses for OpenDevice(). "Baud" and "Control" define the
	default values for baud rate and control information for whenever
	that serial handler is accessed by name only, without explicit baud
	rate and control information specified.

   NOTES
	You can override the device name, speed, unit number, etc. at open
	time using the following template:

	    AUX:DEVICE/K,BAUD/N,UNIT/K/N,FLOW=HANDSHAKE/K,CONTROL/F

	Instead of blank spaces, keywords must be separated by slashes ("/").

	Here is an example:

	    NewShell AUX:DEVICE=serial.device/BAUD=9600/UNIT=0/CONTROL=8N1
