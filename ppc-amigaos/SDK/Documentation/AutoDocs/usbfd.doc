   A Function Driver, in the context of an AutoStarting Function Driver,
   is nothing more than an Exec style library with a specific set of
   functions, as defined by this AutoDoc.

   The responsabilities of a Function Driver is to be able to handle a
   specific class/subclass or vendor specific class of USB Functions.
   The USB System Software will, when a USB device is inserted, see if
   an AutoStarting Function Driver is installed. If a driver is found
   its library will be opened, and the driver entry point called.

   A driver is allowed to handle more than one type of USB Functions.
   When calling the driver entry point a descriptor for the USB Function
   is passed. Using this descriptor the Function Driver can determine if
   it can actually handle the USB Function. If not, the USB System
   Software will keep looking for another driver.

   For doing a rough determination if the Function Driver is able to
   handle a USB Function a set of Function Driver Descriptor files must
   exist. Each of these files tell the USB System Software of a specific
   class or subclass of devices, and the Function Driver library capable
   of handling them. Each Function Driver Descriptor has a priority set,
   allowing more drivers for the same class or subclass. If the highest
   priority driver fails to cope with the USB Function (as mentioned
   above), the USB System Software will try drivers with a lower priority.
   It is perfectly legal to have multiple Function Driver Descriptors
   for each Function Driver library. This allows a Function Driver to
   be able to support non-related USB Functions within the same library.

   Function Drivers wanting to be available during OS boot cannot rely on
   a Function Driver Descriptor file for registering with the USB stack.
   During OS boot when the USB stack is started there is no DOS, and thus
   no way to read the Function Driver Descriptor files. Therefore, if a
   Function Driver wants to be available during OS boot, it should register
   itself using usbresource.library during coldboot. See the
   usbresource.doc for information on how to do that.
   It is perfectly legal for a Function Driver to both have a Function
   Driver Descriptor file AND to register itself with usbresource.library.

   Function Driver descriptors

      Each AutoStarting Function Driver should have a descriptor file,
      informing the USB System that the driver exist, and which USB devices
      the driver can handle (Function Drivers which are launched by other
      means than by the USB stack can instead register with the USB stack
      using usbresource.library).
      A Function Driver descriptor file is a text file holding keyword-
      and-value pairs describing the capabilities of the Function Driver.
      Function Driver descriptor files are placed in "DEVS:USB/fdclasses/".
      The defined keywords are outlined below.

      FUNCTIONDRIVER
         A Function Driver descriptor file must start with this keyword on
         the first line of the file. If this keyword is not present the USB
         System will not interpret the file as a Function Driver descriptor.

      NAME
         The value of this keyword is a name for the Function Driver
         described.

      VENDOR
         The value of this keyword is a USB VendorID value for the device
         vendor that the Function Driver is supporting.
         This keyword is only needed for vendor specific Function Drivers
         and should generally not be inserted in a Descriptor. Leaving out
         the VENDOR keyword indicates that all USB Vendors are accepted by
         the Function Driver.

      PRODUCT
         The value of this keyword is a USB ProductID value for a specific
         product that the Function Driver is supporting. As ProductIDs are
         vendor specific you should only use this keyword if you also define
         a specific vendor using the VENDOR keyword.

      CLASS
         The value of this keyword is a hex value specifying the USB class
         code supported by the Function Driver. If this is not specified
         the USB System interprets the Function Drivers as capable of
         handling all USB classes.

      SUBCLASS
         The value of this keyword is a hex value specifying the USB
         subclass code supported by the Function Driver. If this is not
         specified the USB System interprets the Function Drivers as capable
         of handling all USB subclasses for the USB class specified by the
         CLASS keyword.

      TYPE
         The value(s) of this keyword determines the type of Function
         Driver the Descriptor is describing. One, or both, of the
         following keyword-values can be supplied after the TYPE keyword:

         FUNCTION (shortnamed FKT)
            If this keyword-value exist the Function Driver is capable of
            driving entire USB Functions. That is, the USBFDRunFunction()
            library call of the Function Driver actually holds a functional
            driver.

         INTERFACE (shortnamed IFC)
            If this keyword-value exist the Function Driver is capable of
            driving USB Interfaces. This is the normal mode of operation
            for Function Drivers. This mean is that USBFDRunInterface()
            of the Function Driver library holds a functional driver.

         Normally Function Drivers only holds Interface support, as this
         is the only thing needed for as-good-as-all occurences. Generally
         the TYPE keyword/value pair of a Descriptor is therefore

            TYPE INTERFACE

      PRI
         The value of this keyword specifies the driver priority. If more
         drivers are able to handle a USB class the driver with the
         highest priority will win.
         The priority is an unsigned byte value.

      DRIVER
         The value of this keyword is the filename of the Function Driver
         library the descriptor file describes. Generally this should be
         supplied without path, making the USB System look in the
         "DEVS:USB/fd" drawer for the driver. If a path is specified in the
         filename the Function Driver library will be opened from that place.
         The full filename must be given for the Function Driver. That is,
         including the standard ".usbfd" file extension.

      STACK
         The value of this keyword is the amount of stack space needed by
         the driver program, specified in bytes.
         If not specified, stack space will be the OS default value (4K).

usbfd.fd/USBFDGetAttrs                                   usbfd.fd/USBFDGetAttrs

   NAME
      USBFDGetAttrs -- Query a Function Driver for its attributes.

   SYNOPSIS
      USBFDGetAttrsA( taglist )
                        A0

      void USBFDGetAttrsA( struct TagItem * );

      USBFDGetAttrs( Tag1, ... )

      void USBFDGetAttrsA( ULONG, ... );


   FUNCTION
      The USS will call this function to obtain various information
      about the Function Driver.
      The FD should only respond to tags it recognizes, and leave
      all other tag values at their preset value.

   TAGS
      USBA_FD_SignalsRunning (LONG *)
         The USB stack will use this tag when querying if the FD will call
         USBFktDriverRunning()/USBIfcDriverRunning() on the Functions or
         Interfaces the FD is given.

         Setting the LONG pointed to by ti_Data to TRUE will make the FD
         responsible for calling USBxxxDriverRunning().

         Setting the LONG pointed to by ti_Data to FALSE, or ignoring this
         tag altogether, will make the USB stack know that you will not be
         calling USBxxxDriverRunning().

         See usbsys.device/USBIfcDriverRunning() and
         usbsys.device/USBFktDriverRunning() for a more in-depth explanation
         on DriverRunning signalling.


   INPUTS
      taglist  -  Pointer to the first TagItem of a taglist. The FD
                  must respond to any supported tags in the list.

   NAME
      USBFDRunFunction -- Function based Function Driver entry point.

   SYNOPSIS
      result = USBFDRunFunction( startmsg )
       D0                            A0

       LONG USBFDRunFunction( struct USBFDStartupMsg * );


   FUNCTION
      First of all, you should not base your Function Driver on USB
      Functions, rather on USB Interfaces. So leave this function as a
      stub returning USBERR_UNSUPPORTED, and code the Function Driver in
      USBFDRunInterface() instead.
      That said, if you have a really good reason to do so, you can
      place your Function Driver code in USBFDRunFunction(). A good
      reason could be some obscure vendor specific device from which you
      need more than one Interface, and you cannot get these Interfaces
      in a safe/guaranteed way by launching separate Interface drivers.
      In fact, this is propably ths *only* good reason!


      This function is called by the USB System when it needs to start
      the Function based Function Driver held in the Function Driver
      library.
      Upon calling, the USB System has already started a new Process
      for the Function Driver. This function needs therefore not
      spawn a new process to run in - it is free to take as much time
      as is needed. As such this function need not return until either
      the USB Function has been detached, or some other event makes
      it relevant for the Function Driver to stop.

      A startup message is passed to the Function Driver. This message
      includes some pre-initialised data. Most importantly:
          A MsgPort for use by the Function Driver.
          An IORequest holding the opened usbsys.device. Setup for
           using the above MsgPort.
          A reference to the USB Function which must be handled by
           the Function Driver.
          The USB device descriptor for the USB Function to be
           handled.

      Be aware that the USB Function reference may be NULL. If this
      occurs the USBFDRunFunction() function must abort and return
      the value USBERR_UNSUPPORTED. This behavior has been included
      to allow USBFDRunFunction() to be failsafe, but also to reserve
      the NULL pointer for future magic tricks.

      The Function Driver entry point must return a status upon exit.
      Based on the status the USB System will either continue looking
      for a Function Driver for the USB Function, or assume that the
      USB Function was handled by the Function Driver.

   NOTE
      The USB System may choose to close the Function Driver library
      immediately after this function returns. So don't count on doing
      some clever multitasking stunts, starting subtasks, and exit the
      function, as the library may be expunged a moment later (unless
      you do your own locking).

   INPUTS
      startupmsg  -  Pointer to a USBFDStartupMsg structure holding
                     various arguments for the Function Driver.
                     This includes a pre-opened usbsys.device, giving
                     the Function Driver easy access to the USB API.

   RESULTS
      This function call must return a value indicating how the Function
      Driver handled the USB Function passed to it.
      This is done by returning either USBERR_NOERROR indicating
      that driver successfully handled the USB Function, or
      USBERR_UNSUPPORTED indicating that the USB Function was not
      supported by the FD.
      If the FD does support the given USB Function but fails to
      initialise itself, it should inform the user and return
      USBERR_NOERROR. Otherwise the USB System will keep on looking
      for a FD for the USB Function.

   NAME
      USBFDRunInterface -- Interface based Function Driver entry point.

   FUNCTION
      This function is called by the USB System when it needs to start

           the Function Driver.
          The USB interface descriptor for the USB Interface to be

      Be aware that the USB Interface reference may be NULL. If this
      occurs the USBFDRunInterface() function must abort and return
