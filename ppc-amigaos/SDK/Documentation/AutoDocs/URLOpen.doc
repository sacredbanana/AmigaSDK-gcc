   NAME
	URLOpen - Pass a hypertext link to the URL: device.

   FORMAT
	URLOpen  "hypertextlink" 

   TEMPLATE
	PROTOCOL/K, LINK/F

   PATH
	C:URLOpen

   FUNCTION
	URLOpen is a dedicated executable for use in script files and for the
	tool menus of external applications, to invoke a hypertext link for
	launch-handler, via the mounted device URL:
	
	URLOpen may also be used as the default tool from workbench project
	icons (V53.3+), or from a shell, to load local files into URL: clients.

	The hypertextlink string is modified by this program to prepend "URL:"
	to it, if it is not already present.

	Currently, launch-handler will use the first non alpha-numeric
	character to separate and identify the leading protocol component of
	the URL string, any further non alpha-numeric characters/s following
	this separator will also be stripped, before passing on the line.

   EXAMPLE
	Via a shell commandline;
	   Open the following hypertext link in a client program.
	       URLOpen  "http://www.hyperion-entertainment.biz"

	   Open the local file "Work:html_docs/data2.html", in a client program.
	       URLOpen  "file = Work:html_docs/data2.html"

	   Open the CD relative local file "domains.html", in a client program.
	       URLOpen  "file = domains.html"

	   Open using the separate PROTOCOL=  control parameter, EG;
	       URLOpen  PROTOCOL=file  "Work:extra_docs/info.html"

	   Start the email client and pass in the destination address.
	       URLOpen  "mailto:sales@domain.com"


	Via a workbench icon;
	   When this command is started as the default tool of a workbench 
	   project type icon, the name of the file will be passed to the URL:
	   device using the "FILE" protocol.

	   EG;  PROTOCOL = <protocol>
	   "FILE" is default for <protocol> when unspecified.
	   Other protocols are as per the tab labels found in URL prefs.


   NOTES
	URL: Client programs do not work with current directory relative
	local files, so launch-handler will always convert relative files to
	an absolute device name centric specification by default.

	This command requires the URL: device to be mounted.
	For programmer information relating to implementing the launch-handler
	feature in your application, see the launch-handler.doc autodoc.
