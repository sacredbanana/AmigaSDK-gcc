   NAME
	ram-handler -- The standard volatile RAM disk filesystem.

   SYNOPSIS
	RAM Disk Filesystem.

   FUNCTION
	The ram-handler creates and maintains the "RAM Disk" Volume.
	The default device name is "RAM" and auto mounts upon system boot.
	The default volume name is "RAM Disk".

	Certain features of the RAM filesystem can be adjusted by commandline
	options when the ram-handler.kmod executable is run from a CLI.

	The commandline ReadArgs() template as of V54 is:
	     MemPools=MP/T, ExtMem=EM/T, DisMountable=DM/T, BlockSize=BS/N,
	          ShowSizeAsAllMemUsed=MU/T, ResetDefault=RESET/S, Report=SHOW/S

	     MemPools = MP (Toggle)
	          Toggles memory pools between "ON" and "OFF". (Default; OFF)

	     DisMountable = DM (Toggle)
	          Toggles the option to allows the filesystem to be dismounted
	          using the "Dismount" command, this is generally used only
	          for testing various system components and is not of practical
	          use for the casual user. (Default; OFF)

	     ExtMem = EM (Toggle)   (Available only for V54+)
	          Toggles between using the new extended memory feature or not.
	          This option will map memory into the 32 bit virtual address
	          space only when an object is accessed, this allows for more
	          than the normal 2 gig of memory to be used for the RAM Disk.
	          The total amount of existing address space used to map any
	          sized file will be one block chunk per concurrent caller.
	          This option will disable memory pools. (Default; OFF)

	     BlockSize = BS (Number)
	          Sets the number of bytes in a virtual "Block", this is the
	          size of the memory chunks used to store file data.
	          Allowable values are between 4000 - 1000000  (4KB to 1MB)
	          Values will be rounded up to a multiple of 4. (Default; 16000)

	     ShowSizeAsAllMemUsed = MU (Toggle)
	          This option toggles between reporting memory usage as only
	          memory used for file data blocks or as the entire memory used
	          which would include the meta-data required for internal block
	          linkage and string buffers, etc...  (Default; ON)

	     ResetDefault = RESET (Keyword Switch)
	          Specifying this keyword will cause any previous values to be
	          reset to the default state, it will also delete any previous
	          configuration file to accomplish this.

	     Report = SHOW (Keyword Switch)
	          Display current settings without changing anything. 


   NOTES
	All configuration option changes require a warm reboot before they will
	take effect.
