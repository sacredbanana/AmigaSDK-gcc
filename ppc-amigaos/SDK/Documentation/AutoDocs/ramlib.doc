   NAME
	RamLib -- Loads disk based libraries and devices for exec.library.

   FUNCTION
	RamLib is started as the first RTF_AFTERDOS module by dos.library upon
	booting of the initial CLI process.

	RamLib patches the IExec->OpenLibrary() and IExec->OpenDevice() 
	functions to allow for disk based loading of libraries or devices.
	Before RamLib patches these functions, only resident-in-memory 
	libraries and devices can be opened by these exec.library functions.

	The IExec->OpenLibrary() and IExec->OpenDevice() functions will have
	the ability to search in various locations after patched by RamLib,
	or, if the location of the required object is known, an absolute path
	can be specified to override the path searching feature.

	The determining factor as to what method is used is by the presence of
	a colon ":" character within the function parameter string.
	If a colon ":" is present in the string, then it is deemed to be an 
	absolute dos.library path string to where the load object resides.
	If the object is not found there, the function aborts with failure.

	If there is no colon ":" present within the parameter string, then the
	following paths are prepended to the supplied parameter string, in the
	following order, until the object is found. 

	LIBRARIES                 DEVICES
	========================================
	"LIBS:"                   "DEVS:"
	"CLASSES:"                "CURRDIR:" 
	"CURRDIR:"                "CURRDIR:Devs"
	"CURRDIR:Libs"            "PROGDIR:"
	"CURRDIR:Classes"         "PROGDIR:Devs"
	"PROGDIR:"
	"PROGDIR:Libs"
	"PROGDIR:Classes"
	

   NOTES
	RamLib currently uses IDOS->AddPart() to add the parameter string to the
	above mentioned paths, the semantics of IDOS->AddPart() apply.

	Since version 53, RamLib creates a file notification for every disk
	loaded object, if the disk object is changed, automatic flushing of the
	resident copy will occur if the open count is zero.
