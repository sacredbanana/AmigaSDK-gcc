   NAME
	EXPUNGE - Expunge shared libraries and devices

   TEMPLATE
	NAME/M,PAT=PATTERN/K,ALL/S

   PATH
	SDK:C/EXPUNGE

   FUNCTION
	EXPUNGE is meant as a software developer tool to force shared
	libraries and devices to expunge themselves. The ramlib process
	is responsible for expunging libraries when the corresponding disk
	file has changed so there should be little need for this command in
	practice. The caching of system libraries and devices is normal and
	users should not be using this command.

	EXPUNGE with no arguments displays the list of devices and libraries
	along with their open count and flags. This is useful to find out
	the names of the objects to expunge.

	EXPUNGE will attempt to expunge the named shared libraries and/or
	devices. Since it is not possible to determine whether an expunge
	succeeds or fails EXPUNGE will always state an object was expunged
	if it was found.

	If PATTERN is specified only libraries and devices matching this
	pattern will be attempted to be expunged. This pattern may be an
	arbitrary DOS style pattern.

	If the ALL switch is present EXPUNGE will attempt to expunge all
	the shared libraries and devices with a usage count of zero. Any
	names specified will be ignored in this case.

   RESULTS
	If EXPUNGE succeeded the return code will be set to 0.

	If EXPUNGE cannot find one or more specified names it will continue
	and the return code will be 5. If EXPUNGE fails completely the
	return code will be 20. The secondary return code will be set
	appropriately.

   EXAMPLES
	1> EXPUNGE

	Displays the current device and library lists. For example:
	    Devices:
	    keyboard.device                1      SUMUSED
	    input.device                   20     SUMUSED

	    Libraries:
	    utility.library                132    SUMUSED
	    graphics.library               72     SUMUSED

	1> EXPUNGE keyboard.device graphics.library

	Expunges both of the named objects. Since the use count
	of these objects is greater than 0 nothing will happen
	but the command will still succeed. This is because there
	is no return code on the Expunge vector.

	1> EXPUNGE ALL

	Expunges all the devices and libraries it can find.

	1> EXPUNGE locale.library

	Expunges all the unused catalogs and replaces the obsolete
	Avail FLUSH technique.

	1> EXPUNGE amiga#?

	Expunges all libraries whose name is starting with "amiga"
	(i.e. amigaguide.library or amigaguide.datatype)
