	Purpose:    To localize C source files.

	Specification:

	(Changed lines are denoted by a vertical bar in the left margin.)

	LOCALIZE has two distinct operation modes:  parsing and
	patching.  You select the mode by supplying or omitting the
	PATCH keyword.

	If the PATCH keyword is not given, LOCALIZE reads each file
	specified (or matched by a wildcard) and writes a record to
	the output for each string found.  Typically, you will
	redirect the output to a file for editing.

	The format of the output records is as follows:

	  file|type|line|start column|end column|message tag|string

	<file> is the name of the file where a string was found.

|	<type> is a single character that may be 'S' for a localizable
|	string, 'E' for a non-localizable string, or 'D' for a
|	non-localizable string that occurs in a '#define'.  (A string
|	is considered non-localizable when it located outside of a C
|	function.)

	<line> is the number of the line in <file> where the string
	was found.

	<start column> is column where the opening double quote (")
	appears.  (The line begins with column 1.)

	<end column> is column where the closing double quote (")
	appears.



	<message tag> is the name that will be used to refer to the
	string.

	<string> is the text that was found.

	If LOCALIZE encounters strings that are defined outside of a
|	function it will set <type> to 'E', or 'D' if that string
|	appears as part of a '#define'.  Strings defined outside
	a function  require special handling because there is no
	program context in which to execute a function call.  Strings
|	described by 'D' or 'E' records are not patched in the source,
|	but are added to the catalog description (.cd) file as
|	comments.  A string occurring in a '#define' receives special
|	treatment because it may or may not be localizable.

|	A type 'D' string may be localized if, and only if, the macro
|	is used exclusively within functions.  Compiler errors will
|	result if the macro is localized and used outside a function. 

	Sometimes localization is undesirable; system assigns (SYS:,
	FONTS:, etc.) or debugging statements (ex: D(bug("oops!")))
	for example.  By using exception files LOCALIZE can be made to
	bypass strings that would otherwise be localized.

	This may be done in two ways; by the contents of a string or
	by that name of a calling function.


	Edit the string record file, deleting entries that should not
	be localized ("S:" for example), and changing the message tags
	if desired.  In particular, if there is a string that appears
	in 10 places there should be 1 message tag that appears in 10
	entries in this file, not 10 message tags each referring to
	the same string.

	WARNING:  Do not alter the ordering of the lines in the string
		  record file.  The lines are sorted first by line
		  number, then by starting column number.  If the
		  string records are not sorted the results are
		  undefined. 

	Run LOCALIZE with the PATCH switch and the edited file string
	record file to create a localized C source file and a Catalog
	Description file (.cd file).  These files will be placed in
	the subdirectory "Localized-Source".

	The directory name may be changed by supplying the DIRECTORY
	keyword and a name.  If <name> contains a colon (':') all
	localized source files and catalog descriptions will be saved
	there.  If <name> does not contain a colon, <name> will be
	concatenated with the directory where a file is found to
	produce an output directory for that file.

	The default behavior of LOCALIZE is to write a .cd file for
	every source file that is patched.  If a common .cd file is
	desired, the MERGECATALOG keyword should be given with the
	desired name for the catalog description file.



	LOCALIZE will write entries to the .cd file in the order
	encountered; the previous version sorted the entries by the
	message ID.  The old behavor may be obtained by supplying the
	SORT switch, which causes localize to sort the .cd file by
	message IDs.

	FUNCTION specifies the name of the function to be called to
	localize a string.  If not supplied, FUNCTION defaults to
	'GetCatalogStr'.

	The TEMPLATE keyword is followed by a string the specifies the
	calling conventions for FUNCTION.  The substitutions available
	for the TEMPLATE string are:

	  %F		 The function name given by FUNCTION
	  %I		 The message tag for the string
	  %S		 The string tag for the string (produced by
			 concatenating _STR to the message tag).
	  %D		 The default string.

	If TEMPLATE is not supplied, the following will be used as the
	default:

	  "(catalog ? %F(catalog, %I, %S) : %S)"

	Assuming the default for FUNCTION, the following string
	record:

	  demo.c|S|3|11|26|MSG_HELLO|hello world\n

	will produce this function call:

	  (catalog ? GetCatalogStr(catalog, MSG_HI, MSG_HI_STR)
	  : MSG_HI_STR)

	(The call generated is shown on two lines for clarity.  In
	actuality, the function call is all on one line.)

	The SILENT keyword suppresses the progress indicators when
	LOCALIZE is running in patch mode.

|	The NEST keyword enables support of nested comments.

	PREPENDFILE (APPENDFILE) specifies a file to be prepended
	(appended) the the generated C source file.  PREPENDSTRING
	(APPENDSTRING) provides similar functionality, but the argment
	is taken as a string rather than a file.

	NOTE:  If the PATCH switch is omitted, all other switches and
	       keywords are silently ignored.




	Examples:

	These examples will be operating on this source file (line numbers
	added for clarity):


	  1:main()
	  2:{
	  3:    printf("hello world\n");
	  4:}


	LOCALIZE operating in parse mode generates one line of output


	  1>LOCALIZE hello.c
	  hello.c|S|3|11|26|MSG_0000|hello world\n


	Usually, you will redirect this output to a file like this:


	  1>LOCALIZE >RAM:strings hello.c


	LOCALIZE operating in patch mode:


	  1>LOCALIZE PATCH RAM:strings
	  Processing RAM:strings...
	    hello.c -> hello.c.new & hello.c.cd
	    patching line 3
	    hello.c done.
	  RAM:strings done.


	This is the C source file produced by LOCALIZE:


	  1: /*
|	  2: **	This file generated by localize 2.9 (AmigaDOS 2.1) from hello.c
	  3: */
	  4: main()
	  5: {
	  6:     printf((catalog?GetCatalogStr(catalog,MSG_0000,MSG_0000_STR)
		    :"hello world\n"));
	  7: }


	And this is the Catalog Description file:


	  1: ;
|	  2: ;	Description generated by localize 2.9 (AmigaDOS 2.1) from hello.c
	  3: ;
	  4: ; line 3
	  5: ;
	  6: MSG_0000 (//)
	  7: hello world\n



	If you find that the C source becomes too unreadable, you may wish
	to try the following, to use a macro to hide some of the work:


	  1>LOCALIZE PATCH TEMPLATE "_S(%I,%S,%D)"
		PS "#define _S(x,y,z)) catalog?GetCatalogStr(catalog,x,y) ? z)"
		RAM:strings

	  Processing RAM:strings...
	    hello.c -> hello.c.new & hello.c.cd
	    Prepending "#define _S(x) catalog?GetCatalogStr(catalog,x,y) ? z)"
	    patching line 3
	    hello.c done.
	  RAM:strings done.


	This is the C source file produced:


	  1: /*
|	  2: **	This file generated by localize 2.9 (AmigaDOS 2.1) from hello.c
	  3: */
	  4:#define _S(x) catalog?GetCatalogStr(catalog,x,y) ? z)
	  5: main()
	  6: {
	  7:     printf(_S(MSG_0000,MSG_0000_STR,"hello world\n"));
	  8: }


	One thing that LOCALIZE does not attempt to support is strings
	that have a global scope.  That is, any string that is not
	part of a function.  For example:

	
	   1:char	*help[] =
	   2:{
	   3:	"Usage: hello <name>",
	   4:	"\tPrint a message saying hello to <name>",
	   5:	"\tIf <name> is omitted, it defaults to \"world\".",
	   6:	0
	   7:};
	   8:
	   9:main ( int argc, char * argv [] )
	  10:{
	  11:    int    i;
	  12:
	  13:	if (argc > 2)
	  14:	    for (i = 0; help[i]; i++)
	  15:           printf(help[i]);
	  16:   else
	  17:       if (argc == 2)
	  18:	        printf("Hello %s!\n", argv[1]);
	  19:	    else
	  20:	        printf("Hello world\n");
	  21:}


	LOCALIZE will issue 'E' records for the strings on lines 3
	through 5 because they occur outside of a function.  There are
	two approachs to resolving these excluded lines.  Both
	approachs are valid and the choice is a function of the
	organization of the data structures and individual preference.



	In this example, the strings are initialized at run time by a
	call to the function initialize:


	   1:char	*help[4];
	   2:
	   3:main ( int argc, char * argv [] )
	   4:{
	   5:    int    i;
	   6:
	   7:	initialize_strings();
	   8:
	   9:	if (argc > 2)
	  10:	    for (i = 0; help[i]; i++)
	  11:           printf(help[i]);
	  12:   else
	  13:       if (argc == 2)
	  14:	        printf("Hello %s!\n", argv[1]);
	  15:	    else
	  16:	        printf("Hello world\n");
	  17:}
	  18:
	  19:void initialize_strings ( void )
	  20:{
	  21:    help[0] = "Usage: hello <name>";
	  22:	 help[1] = "\tPrint a message saying hello to <name>";
	  23:	 help[2] = "\tIf <name> is omitted, it defaults to \"world\".";
	  24:	 help[3] = 0;
	  25:}


	With the string initialization in a function, LOCALIZE can
	generate code that will correctly retrieve the localized
	strings at runtime. 

	The other scheme is a little more involved, but is well suited
	for repetitive structures and large arrays.  

	After patching the source file shown above, the resulting
	initialize_strings() function:


	  22:void initialize_strings ( void )
	  23:{
	  24:    help[0] = catalog
			   ? GetCatalogStr(catalog, MSG_0000, MSG_0000_STR)
			   : MSG_0000_STR;
	  25:    help[1] = catalog
			   ? GetCatalogStr(catalog, MSG_0001, MSG_0001_STR)
			   : MSG_0001_STR;
	  26:    help[2] = catalog
			   ? GetCatalogStr(catalog, MSG_0002, MSG_0002_STR)
			   : MSG_0002_STR;
	  27:	 help[3] = 0;
	  28:}



	is changed to the following.  The GetString function is
	adapted from the one presented in the 1991 DevCon notes.


	  22:void initialize_strings ( void )
	  23:{
	  24:    int    i;
	  25:
	  26:    for (i = MSG_0000; i <= MSG_0002; i++)
	  27:        help[i] = GetString(catalog, i);
	  28:	 help[i] = 0;
	  29:}
	  30:
	  31:STRPTR NotFoundString = "localized string not found";
	  32:                                   
          33:STRPTR GetString ( struct Catalog * catalog, ULONG id)
          34:{
          35:    STRPTR local = NotFoundString;
          36:    UWORD  i, last;
          37:
          38:    last = sizeof(AppStrings) / sizeof(AppStrings[0]);
          39:
          40:    for (i = 0; i < last; i++)
          41:    {
          42:        if(AppStrings[i].as_ID == id)
          43:        {
          44:            local = AppStrings[i].as_Str;
          45:            break;
          46:        }
          47:    }
          48:
          49:    if (LocaleBase && catalog && *local)
          50:        local = GetCatalogStr(catalog, id, local);
	  51:
          52:    return(local);
          53:}


	These methods may also be applied to structure initializations:


	     struct TextAttr TOPAZ80 =
	     {
		     "topaz.font", TOPAZ_EIGHTY, 0, 0
	     };


	     struct IntuiText Hello =
	     {
		     0, 1, JAM2, 10, 10,
		     &TextAttr, "Hello World!", NULL
	     };


	Could become the following, allowing LOCALIZE to generate
	function calls to initialize the appropriate structure members
	at run time rather than at compile time.



	NOTE: The string, "topaz.font" is not changed.  The font name
	      is not localized and the string record for it must be
	      deleted from the string record file.


	     struct TextAttr TOPAZ80 =
	     {
		     "topaz.font",
		     TOPAZ_EIGHTY,
		     0, 0
	     };

	     struct IntuiText Hello =
	     {
		     0, 1,
		     JAM2,
		     10, 10,
		     &TextAttr,
		     NULL,
		     NULL
	     };

	     initialize_strings()
	     {
		     Hello.IText = "Hello World!";
	     }
