With locale.library V50+ its possible to use a
language.catalog file which overwrites the builtin
strings of the language driver. May be useful to correct
typos or errors or to add strings in future which are
not defined yet.

BuildLanguageCT can be used to create a language.ct file.
Together with Locale-Source/language.cd this can be used
to create the language.catalog file with CatComp.

Usage:

BuildLanguageCT >language.ct

will create a language.ct file with the builtin strings
of the current system default language driver.

BuildLanguageCT can also be used for a quick check of the
builtin strings of the current system default language
driver, just call it without output redirection.

See also the comments in Locale-Source/language.cd.
