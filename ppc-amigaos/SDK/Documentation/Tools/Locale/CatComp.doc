                 =============================================

CatComp is a program to handle the creation and maintenance of the message
catalogs used by locale.library. Message catalogs are IFF files read by
locale.library that contain all the text strings used by an application. By
providing several of these catalog files, an application can use
locale.library and transparently adapt itself to the user's preferred language.

CatComp reads and processes two kinds of input files, and produces five types
of output files.

The first kind of file read by CatComp is a catalog description file. That
file describes all the strings used by an application. There is one such file
per localized application. In this file, you assign numbers to all the
application strings as well as specify their minimum and maximum lengths.

The second kind of file read by CatComp is a catalog translation file. That
file contains all strings from the application translated to one language.
There is one catalog translation file per language supported by a localized
application.

CatComp can produce several different kinds of output files. The first is an IFF
catalog. These are regular IFF files. There is one catalog produced for every
catalog text file successfully processed. Catalogs are read directly by
locale.library whenever the OpenCatalog() call is made.

The second type of file output by CatComp is an empty translation file. This
is useful when starting a translation. It lets CatComp convert a catalog
description file into a ready to fill-in translation file.

The third type of file output by CatComp is a new translation file based
on an old one. This is useful when re-starting a translation after a
catalog description file was modified, because the new and the modified
strings will be stored in the the new catalog translation file.

The fourth and fifth type of files output by CatComp are C and Assembly
language programming source files. These are used by application writers to
convert catalog description files into source files that can be directly used
in their applications.

The sixth and seventh type of files output by CatComp are Modula-2 language
definition and implementation source files, which are used by programmers
in much the same way C and Assembly files are used.

Finally, the last type of file output by CatComp is an AmigaDOS load file.
These load files are used by application writers to include a set of strings
directly inside an application. This is normally used to encode the default
strings that an application uses when there are no external catalogs available.


Invoking CatComp
----------------

CatComp must be started from the Shell under Kickstart V37 or beyond. Its
template is:

  DESCRIPTOR/A,TRANSLATION,CATALOG/K,CTFILE/K,CFILE/K,
  SYMBOLS/M/K,VB=VERBOSITY/N/K,
  NOOPTIM/S,NONUMBERS/S,NOSTRINGS/S,NOARRAY/S,NOBLOCK/S,NOCODE/S,
  SORT/S,COMMENTS/S

in the PPC version and

  DESCRIPTOR/A,TRANSLATION,CATALOG/K,CTFILE/K,CFILE/K,ASMFILE/K,M2FILE/K,
  OBJFILE/K,SYMBOLS/M/K,VB=VERBOSITY/N/K,NOOPTIM/S,NONUMBERS/S,NOSTRINGS/S,
  NOARRAY/S,NOBLOCK/S,NOCODE/S,XDEF/S,SORT/S,COMMENTS/S

in the 68k version.

  DESCRIPTOR/A
  Specifies the name of a catalog description file. Typically, the file
  extension for catalog description files is .cd

  TRANSLATION
  Specifies the name of a catalog translation file. Typically, the
  file extension for catalog translation files is .ct

  CATALOG/K
  Specifies the name of the IFF catalog file to produce. When this option
  is specified, a translation file must have been given in the previous
  argument.

  CTFILE/K
  Specifies the name of the catalog translation file to produce. This
  option only requires a catalog descriptor file be provided, then the
  catalog translation file will be blank. When you also specified
  a source translation file, the version string, language, codeset and
  strings of the source translation file will be copied to the new
  translation file.

  CFILE/K
  Specifies the name of the C-language source file header to produce. This
  option only requires a catalog descriptor file be provided, there is no need
  for a translation file.

  ASMFILE/K (68k version only)
  Specifies the name of the Assembly-language source file header to produce.
  This option only requires a catalog descriptor file be provided, there is
  no need for a translation file.

  M2FILE/K (68k version only)
  Specifies the _base_ name of the Modula-2 source files to produce. Two
  files are actually generated. The first file has the base name with the
  extension .def, the second has the extension .mod added.

  OBJFILE/K (68k version only)
  Specifies the name of the AmigaDOS binary object file to produce.
  This option only requires a catalog descriptor file be provided, there is
  no need for a translation file.

  SYMBOLS/M/K
  Specifies any number of symbols that are used to determine which section
  of the available strings get included within generated C, Assembly, and
  object files.

  VERBOSITY/N/K
  Specifies the amount of information CatComp should output while doing some
  processing. The lower this number, the less CatComp will output messages.
  At verbosity level 0, no warnings will appear.
  At verbosity level 1 or higher, warnings about C-language formatting commands
  and warnings about missing strings in catalog translation files can appear.
  At verbosity level 2 or higher, warnings about missing trailing ellipsis
  (...) in catalog description files can appear.
  At verbosity level 3 (which is the default) or higher, warnings about
  trailing blank characters and non-ASCII characters in catalog
  description files can appear.
  At verbosity level 4  or higher, CatComp will output every message
  it could. This includes warnings about identical strings in catalog
  descriptor and catalog translation files (which are not shown when
  the NOOPTIM switch was specified).

  NOOPTIM/S
  When generating a catalog file, CatComp normally skips strings that are
  identical in the catalog descriptor file and in the catalog translation
  file and does not include them in the generated catalog file. This
  option disables this optimization.

  NONUMBERS/S
  This option is only useful when generate C or Assembly-language header
  files. It prevents the generation of the CATCOMP_NUMBERS section within
  the header file.

  NOSTRINGS/S
  This option is only useful when generate C or Assembly-language header
  files. It prevents the generation of the CATCOMP_STRINGS section within
  the header file.

  NOARRAY/S
  This option is only useful when generate C or Assembly-language header
  files. It prevents the generation of the CATCOMP_ARRAY section within
  the header file.

  NOBLOCK/S
  This option is only useful when generate C or Assembly-language header
  files. It prevents the generation of the CATCOMP_BLOCK section within
  the header file.

  NOCODE/S
  This option is only useful when generate C or Assembly-language header
  files. It prevents the generation of the CATCOMP_CODE section within
  the header file.

  XDEF/S (68k version only)
  This option is only useful when generate Assembly-language header files.
  It adds XDEF declarations for all IDs (CATCOMP_NUMBERS section) and 
  string labels (CATCOMP_STRINGS section).

  SORT/S
  When specified, all strings will be sorted by ID before they are written
  to header/assembler/object/catalog files. Catalog translation files will,
  however, get written in the same order in which the strings showed up in
  the catalog descriptor file.

  COMMENTS/S
  When both this switch and CTFILE were specified, the comment lines from
  the catalog description file will be copied into the new catalog
  translation file.


Catalog Description Files
-------------------------

Catalog description files completely describe the strings used by an
application. The format for these files is basically a series of two line
entries separated by an arbitrary number of comment lines. The EBNF (Extended
Backus Naur Formalism) specification for catalog description files is:

{# command}
{; comment line}
<string name> "(" [string id] "/" [min string len] "/" [max string len] ")"
[string]

The first line indicates special commands that provide control over the
generation of C, Assembly, and object files. See the section on C and Assembly
source files below for further information.

<string name> is the symbolic name of the string. Following the name comes
three optional numbers enclosed in parenthesis and separated with slashes.
Any number (including 0) of spaces and tabs is accepted around the
parenthesis and slashes. The first number specifies the string's ID value.
This is the ID value used to request this string when using the
GetCatalogStr() call in locale.library. The second number specifies the
minimum length for the string, while the third number specifies the
maximum string length.

The next line of an entry contains the actual string. Within the catalog
description file, the strings are the same as the default strings built into
the application. The strings can use standard C-language backslash ("\")
escape sequences. If a string ends with a backslash character, this means
that the next line in the file should be considered a continuation of the
current line.

Finally, any string entry can be separated from other entries by comment
lines. Comment lines start with a semicolon. There can be any number of
comment lines between two entries. It is not allowed to put comment lines
between the two lines of a same entry.

Here's an example of two strings in a catalog description file:

MSG_HELLO (0/4/50)
This is a test string for the world to see
;
MSG_BYE (1/14/47)
This is another test string

The first string is called MSG_HELLO, has 0 as ID value, can be as short
as 4 characters and as long as 50. The string actually associated with the
name follows on the next line. Then comes a comment line. Following that is
the definition of the second string called BYE_WORLD_STR that has 1 as ID
value, can be as short as 14 characters and as long as 47.

As mentioned above, all three numbers in an entry are optional. If the string
id number is not specified, then the same id as the previous string in the
file plus one is used. If the first string defined has no id value, the
starting id value is 0. If the minimum string length is not specified, it is
assumed to be 0. And finally, if the maximum string length is not specified,
it is assumed to be unlimited.

All three numbers can be provided in hexadecimal by preceeding themby
a $. For string IDs, it is also possible to specify a relative value. That
is, by providing an ID value of "+1", you are telling CatComp to add one
to the ID number this string was going to receive. This is useful over
the course of evolution of a program, when certain strings need to be removed.
An example would be:

MSG_HELLO (0/4/50)
This is a test string for the world to see
;
MSG_BYE (+1/14/47)
This is another test string
;
MSG_WELCOME (//)
This is still a test string!

In this case, MSG_HELLO would have the value 0, MSG_BYE the value 2,
and MSG_WELCOME the value 3.

A note on style here. It is relatively important to choose descriptive
symbolic names for the strings. These names will be viewed by the translators
and should be as meaningful as possible. The following conventions are
suggested:

  - List all names in capital letters. This will make it clear they are
    constants as this is the convention used in all Amiga include files.

  - Prefix each name with the string MSG_. This will make it clear to the
    programmer that a given constant is in fact a string ID value.

  - Append the string _GAD to strings that are used for gadget labels.

  - Append the string _MENU to strings that are used for menu titles. For
    example, MSG_EDIT_MENU.

  - Expand the path leading to a menu item when specifying strings that are
    used for menu items. For example, for the Cut item in the Edit menu
    would be written as MSG_EDIT_CUT.


Catalog Translation Files
-------------------------

Catalog translation files contain all the strings of an application translated
to a different language than the default. The files look very similar to
catalog description files, except they do not include the string id, minimum
string length and maximum string length specifications. The EBNF specification
for catalog translation files is:

{# command}
{; comment line}
<string name>
[string]

The first line indicates special commands that describe attributes of the
catalog file. Any number of spaces, tabs and '#' characters may appear
between the first '#' character and the command. There are currently five
supported commands:

- "version" lets you specify a 2.0-style version string for the catalog.

- "language" lets you list the language that this catalog is in. This
  string should itself be in the given language and not in English for
  pre-OS4 catalogs and in English for OS4 catalogs.

- "codeset" lets you specify in which charset this catalog is written.
  This value should specify the IANA MIBenum charset number of the charset
  used to write the .ct file which can be found in
  L:charsets/character-sets or L:charsets/custom-character-sets or
  http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets. OS4 currently supports
  all 8bit charsets that have a mapping table to Unicode in L:charsets/
  plus UTF-8. Older AmigaOS versions did only support ISO-8859-1.

- "rcsid" lets you specify a version string using the standard RCS method.
  That way, versions of catalogs can get updated automatically by RCS.

- "name" can be used in conjunction with the "rcsid" command to specify
  the name component of a 2.0 version string. For example:

  ## rcsid $Date: 2007-05-29 07:36:41 $ $Revision: 1.17 $
  ## name myprogram.catalog

  The above will embed "$VER: myprogram.catalog 1.13 (5.2.2007)" inside of the
  message catalog.

Another example:

## version $VER: myprogram.catalog 51.1 (31.7.2004)
## codeset 4
## language french
;
MSG_HELLO
Ceci est une chaine test pour être vue
;
MSG_BYE
Ceci est une autre chaine test

The first three lines are command lines. The following line is a comment line
as it starts with a semicolon. The following line you list the symbolic name
of the string, and on the second line the translated string. If a string ends
with a backslash character, this means that the next line in the file should
be considered a continuation of the current line.

The symbolic name is the same as the related entry in the catalog description
file. CatComp uses this name to associate entries from translation files with
entries in description files. It can then validate the strings in the
translation files by ensuring they are of the correct length, etc.


Escape Sequences Supported
--------------------------

Regular C-language escape sequences can be specified in strings, along with a
few additions:

  \a	inserts an audible bell character (ASCII 7)
  \b    inserts a backspace character (ASCII 8)
  \c    inserts a control sequence introducer (ISO-8859-1 155)
  \e    inserts an escape character (ASCII 27)
  \f    inserts a formfeed character (ASCII 12)
  \n    inserts a newline character (ASCII 10)
  \r    inserts a carriage return character (ASCII 13)
  \t    inserts a tab character (ASCII 9)
  \v    inserts a vertical tab character (ASCII 11)
  \"    inserts a quotation mark character (ASCII 34)
  \\    inserts a backslash character (ASCII 92)
  \xNN  inserts NN, where NN specifies a character code in hexadecimal
  \NNN  inserts NNN, where NNN specifies a character code in octal

As well, when any string line within a description or translation file ends
with a backslash ("\"), it means that the following line within the file is
to be considered a continuation of the current line.


Formatted Output Commands
-------------------------

By default, CatComp parses strings for C-language formatting commands as
used in the printf() function. This can be switched off with the
#printf_check_off command in the catalog description file and switched
back on with the #printf_check_on command.

The check, when enabled, ensures that the number and type of such commands
are the same in both the description file and the translation files. This
guarantees that the application stack frame will not be misinterpreted due
to incorrect translations of formatting commands.

CatComp warns you if you attempt to use any non-C formatting commands. The
commands that CatComp does understand are:

    %b %c %d %D %e %E %f %g %G %i %o %p %s %u %U %x %X %N %T

CatComp also knows about the ordering formatting command supported by
RawDoFmt() whenever locale.library runs in the system, or by locale's
FormatString() routine. The ordering command lets you specify formatting
commands within a formatting string in a different order than in the original
string, while still accessing the stack frame correctly. CatComp validates the
ordering information and ensures argument types match. See the documentation
locale.library/FormatString().

Specifying the argument position lets the order of the % commands within your
strings without affecting how the program performs. Given a string in a
catalog description file such as:

MSG_AVAIL_MEM (//)
FAST: %lU, GRAPHIC: %lU

This string could be translated in French as:

MSG_AVAIL_MEM (//)
GRAPHIQUE: %2$lU, AUTRE %1$lU

Using the first string, the output of the program might look like:

FAST: 1234, GRAPHIC: 5678

while the translation would output:

GRAPHIQUE: 5678, AUTRE: 1234

An example how to use the #printf_check_#? commands:

MSG_ERROR_OPEN_FILE (//)
Can't open file \"%s\".
;
#printf_check_off
;
MSG_HPDJ_DENSITY5_TXT (//)
25% depletion, 50% shingling
;
MSG_HPDJ_DENSITY6_TXT (//)
25% depletion, 25% shingling
;
#printf_check_on
;
MSG_ERROR_READ_FILE (//)
Can't read from file \"%s\".
;

Validation
----------

CatComp enforces the syntax of catalog description files and catalog
translation files very strongly. It also ensures that the same number of
C-language % command appear in both the description and the translation file.
This guarantees the integrity of the application stack-frame when using
translated string in printf() statements.

Most errors detected by CatComp are fatal and cause the program to abort.
Errors are reported to the console with a descriptive error message, a
filename, and if needed a line and column number. Non-fatal errors (warnings)
and also sent to the console, but they do not cause the program to abort. The
printing of these warning messages can be suppressed using the VERBOSITY
command-line option.


Possible Errors
---------------

Here is an incomplete list of the errors and warnings that CatComp can
produce, along with an explanation of what went wrong. Most errors
indicate the file, line and column where the error occurred to help in
solving the problem. Note that when using strings with the line
continuation character ("\"), the line numbers printed will refer to the
last line of the strings, even though the error may be in the first line.

ERROR: string line for token <name> not found
  A given token was not followed by a string

ERROR: token not found
  No token was found on a line in a catalog description file. Comment lines
  must start with ";", any other line must have a valid token definition on
  it.

ERROR: '(' expected
  There was no number section after a token in a catalog description file.
  The number section must start with a (, followed by three optional numbers
  separated by slashes, and terminated by a ).

ERROR: ')' expected
  There was no ) after a number section in a catalog description file.
  The number section must start with a (, followed by three optional numbers
  separated by slashes, and terminated by a ).

ERROR: '/' expected
  There was no slash found within a number section after a token in a catalog
  description file. The number section must start with a (, followed by three
  optional numbers separated by slashes, and terminated by a ). So there
  must always be two slashes specified.

ERROR: garbage characters after token <name>
  There was no number section after a token in a catalog description file,
  and garbage characters were found instead, The number section must start
  with a (, followed by three optional numbers separated by slashes, and
  terminated by a ).

ERROR: <name> is not a valid token
  A token in a catalog description file was composed of invalid characters.
  A token must start with a letter and can be followed by letters, numbers and
  underscores.

ERROR: token <name> not found
  A token specified in a catalog description file was not present in
  a translation file and the NOOPTIM switch was used.

ERROR: string too short for token <name>
  A string in a translation file is shorter than the minimum length
  specified in the description file.

ERROR: string too long for token <name>
  A string in a translation file is shorter than the minimum length
  specified in the description file.

ERROR: negative value for minimum length
  The minimum string length specified for a token must be positive.

ERROR: negative value for maximum length
  The maximum string length specified for a token must be positive.

ERROR: non-positive value for % ordering
  The position information for a % formatting command must be positive and
  greater than 1.

ERROR: % ordering value too large
  The position information for a % formatting command is greater than the
  number of formatting commands provided

ERROR: % size incorrect
  The size specifier for a % formatting command in a translation file does
  not match the size in the description file.

ERROR: % command does not match
  The type specifier for a % formatting command in a translation file does
  not match the size in the description file.

ERROR: token <name> defined multiple times
  A token was defined multiple times in either a description or a translation
  file.

ERROR: id <number> already used for token <name>
  An attempt was made to reuse an ID value twice within a description file

ERROR: no command found after '#'
  Command lines start with # and are followed by any number of spaces,
  tabs and '#' characters and then a command.

ERROR: <name> is not a valid command after '#'
  A command specified after # is invalid.

ERROR: <number> is not a valid codeset value
  An incorrect codeset value was specified for a #codeset command.

ERROR: <string> is not a valid rcsid value
  A string in an incorrect format was specified for an #rcsid command.
  The format expected is
  ## rcsid $Date: 2007-05-29 07:36:41 $ $Revision: 1.17 $

ERROR: couldn't write catalog <name>
  An error occurred while writing the catalog file

WARNING: <name> is an unknown formatting command
  An unknown % formatting command was specified. CatComp knows only of
  C-language formatting commands, anything else will be flagged
  with this warning.

WARNING: string for token <name> matches string in descriptor
  A string within a translation file matches exactly the original string
  from the description file. This may mean that the string was not
  translated. CatComp will not bother putting the string in any
  generated catalog when this situation occurs, unless the NOOPTIM
  command-line option is specified

WARNING: original string for token <name> had a trailing ellipsis (...)
  The original string in the catalog descriptor file had a trailing
  ellipsis (such as "Open..."), but the translation did not.

WARNING: token <name> not found
  A token specified in a catalog description file was not present in
  a translation file and the NOOPTIM switch was not used. Then the string
  will not be written into the output catalog file.


C, Assembly, and Modula-2 Source Files
--------------------------------------

CatComp has the ability to output C, Assembly and Modula-2 language source
file. This lets application programmers manipulate a single catalog description
file and have source files generated for them automatically so they can include
the strings in their programs.

To generate these files, you need to give CatComp a descriptor file, and either
a C, Assembly, or Modula-2 output file name using the CFILE/K, ASMFILE/K, and
M2FILE/K command-line options. The resulting files will be standard C,
Assembly, and/or Modula-2 source files that can be used from application code.

Both C and Assembly source files contain multiple sections. You can choose
which sections of these files you want in your application by using standard
conditional compilation symbol definitions. Here is a list of the various
symbols and the type of data they hold:

  CATCOMP_NUMBERS
  Defining this symbol causes the name of each string to be defined with the
  value of its id, as listed in the catalog description file. So if the .cd
  file contains a string such as:

      MSG_HELLO (141//)
      Hello

  then the C file generated would have

      #define MSG_HELLO 141

  and for Assembly:

      MSG_HELLO EQU 141

  CATCOMP_STRINGS
  Defining this symbol causes each string to be defined. Using the same
  example as above, you would get the following for C:

      MSG_HELLO_STR "Hello"

  and for Assembly:

      MSG_HELLO_STR: DC.B 'Hello',$00

  CATCOMP_ARRAY
  Causes a table of the following structures to become available:

      struct CatCompArrayType
      {
          LONG         cca_ID;
          CONST_STRPTR cca_Str;
      };

  cca_ID contains the id value of a string, and cca_Str points to the string
  itself. By scanning this array, you can access all of the strings defined
  for the application.

  CATCOMP_BLOCK
  Causes a compact table of all the strings and their id values to be
  generated. The format is:

      1 longword of string id
      1 word of string length
      string
      ..etc...

  This type of table is difficult to parse in C, and generally better handled
  in Assembly.

  CATCOMP_CODE
  This causes the generation of source code for a function called GetString().
  The function takes for argument an initialized LocaleInfo structure and a
  string number. It returns a string pointer. The LocaleInfo structure is:

    struct LocaleInfo
    {
    #ifndef __amigaos4__
        struct Library     *li_LocaleBase;
    #else
        struct LocaleIFace *li_ILocale;
    #endif
        struct Catalog     *li_Catalog;
    }

  li_LocaleBase should be initialized to the return value of
  OpenLibrary() of locale.library, or NULL if the library can't be opened.
  li_ILocale should be initialized to the return value of
  GetInterface() of locale.library, or NULL if the library can't be opened.
  li_Catalog should be initialized to the result of OpenCatalog() of the
  application's catalog. This value can be NULL.

Command-line options are available to disable the generation of specific
sections of header files. These are NONUMBERS/S, NOSTRINGS/S, NOARRAY/S,
NOBLOCK/S, and NOCODE/S.

Special commands can be embedded in catalog description files to provide
control over the generation of header files. These commands are introduced
by a # symbol within the catalog description file. Any number of spaces,
tabs and '#' characters may appear between the first '#' character and the
command. The supported commands are:

  #version <version number>
  This lets you specify which catalog version number is required by the
  application and should be used in the #version command of the catalog
  translation file. For example:

      #version 46

      would cause a "#version $VER: sample.catalog 51.1 (31.3.2005)"
      command in the .ct file to cause a version mismatch error message.

  A version number of 0 means any version will be accepted, this was
  added for compatibility.

  #header <header name>
  This lets you indicate the base name of the header files being produced.
  The base name is then used as the top of header files. For example:

      #header TEXTTABLE

      would cause the following to be added at the start of the C header file:

      #ifndef TEXTTABLE_H
      #define TEXTTABLE_H

  #array <array base name>
  This lets you specify the base name of the arrays generated in the header
  files being produced. The default is "CatCompArray"

  #block <block base name>
  This lets you specify the base name of the data block generated in the header
  files being produced. The default is "CatCompBlock"

  #arrayopts <compiler options>
  This lets you specify which compiler option should be used when
  generating arrays of data. The default is "static const".

  #function <function name>
  This lets you specify the name of the function that is generated.
  The default is "GetString"

  #prototype <function prototype line>
  This lets you specify the function prototype to output in generated
  C header files. By default, no prototype is generated. For SAS/C and
  68k gcc you can do something like:

    #prototype #include <exec/types.h>\n
       STRPTR ASM GetString(REG(a0, struct LocaleInfo *li),
                            REG(d0, ULONG id));

  Note that the above three lines actually have to appear on a single line in
  a descriptor file. They are on separate lines here just so they fit
  within an 80 column display. The main purpose for generating a prototype
  is to allow interfacing to the code generated when using the OBJFILE
  option. The prototype lets you define in which registers the parameters are
  expected in by the object code. Since the register specification
  mechanism is compiler-dependant, CatComp can't generate a standard
  prototype that covers all cases, so it requires the explicit specification
  of what the generated prototype should be.

  This command is also used when generating Modula-2 source files. It
  specifies the function definition used when generating a .def file.

  #m2prolog
  This is used when generating Modula-2 .mod files. It preceeds the
  M2 code that is generated. You can put IMPORT statements and the
  function definition in this command.

  #m2epilog
  This is used when generating Modula-2 .mod files. It follows the
  M2 code that is generated. This is normally used to include the
  END <functionname> line after the generated code sequence.

  #ifdef <symbol name>
  Causes CatComp to enclose the following identifiers within a conditional
  compilation block.

  #endif <symbol name>
  Causes CatComp to terminate the current conditional compilation block.

  #printf_check_off
  Switches off interpreting the following strings as C-language formatting
  commands.

  #printf_check_on
  Switches on interpreting the following strings as C-language formatting
  commands.

  #lengthbytes <number of bytes>
  Causes CatComp to precede every following strings with 'n' bytes of length
  information. The default number of bytes is 0. The
  locale.library/GetCatalogStr() function will then return a pointer
  to the length bytes, followed by the actual string. The length
  indicated does NOT include the length bytes themselves.

  #language
  In a .cd file CatComp simply ignores this command for compatibility.

  #basename
  In a .cd file CatComp simply ignores this command for compatibility.


Object Files
------------

68k CatComp is capable of generating linkable Amiga load files directly. These
load files contain all the strings for an application, and a very small and
fast routine to return a string pointer given a string id value.

The OBJFILE/K option takes the name of an Amiga load file to generate. This
file can then be linked directly with an application. A single function is
available within this load file. It is the Assembly version of the GetString()
function described in the previous section.


Sample Use
----------

This section presents sample uses of CatComp with example command-lines.

Assume you have a catalog description file for an application called "app.cd".


To test if this file is a valid .cd file, type:

  CatComp app.cd

and CatComp will respond with either some error messages, or with a message
saying that 'app.cd' is a valid descriptor file.


To do a translation of a .cd file, you need a .ct file. Such a file can be
generated by doing:

  CatComp app.cd CTFILE app.ct

This will create a blank translation file called app.ct. You can then load
app.ct in a standard text editor and proceed to translate the strings it
contains.

Once a .ct file is done being translated, it must be converted in an IFF
catalog file. This is done by doing:

  CatComp app.cd app.ct CATALOG app.catalog

This will create a file called app.catalog.


See the accompanying HelloWorld program for a complete example of a localized
program using the efficient CATCOMP_CODE approach.
