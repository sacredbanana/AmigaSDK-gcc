   NAME
	BUILDMAPTABLE - Create a binary mapping table to Unicode for
	                diskfont.library from an ASCII mapping table.

   FORMAT
	BUILDMAPTABLE <ASCII mapping table> [CHARSET]

   TEMPLATE
	UNICODEMAPTABLE/A,CHARSET/K

   PATH
	C:BUILDMAPTABLE

   FUNCTION
	BUILDMAPTABLE converts Charset-To-Unicode mapping tables in text form
	(e.g. available at http://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/) to
	mapping tables in binary form usable by diskfont.library.

	You must specify a charset mapping table file name when using
	the BUILDMAPTABLE command.

	BUILDMAPTABLE can either display a text form of the parsed table
	or create a binary mapping table in the L:Charsets/ directory.
	Currently only 8bit charset mapping tables are supported.

	If L:Charsets/character-sets or L:Charsets/custom-character-sets
	contains a MIME name for an 8bit charset where no mapping table
	in L:Charsets/ does exist, and you have a mapping table in text form,
	use BUILDMAPTABLE to create the binary mapping table and reboot
	(diskfont.library searches tables only once) to be able to use
	the new charset (e.g. in fonts or catalog files).

	The expected format of text mapping tables is as follows:
	- Anything from a '#' character to the end of a line is
	  considered a comment.
	- A valid line does contain the index on the left and the
	  Unicode code point at the right side, in either hexadecimal
	  (starting with 0x or 0X) or octal (starting with 0) or
	  decimal form, separated by empty space. Example:
	  0xA4	0x20AC	#	EURO SIGN

   OPTIONS
	The other options are:

	CHARSET

	    Specify a MIME charset name or alias. The MIME charset name
	    obtained from diskfont.library will be used as file name of
	    the binary charset mapping table which will be stored in
	    L:Charsets/. If the CHARSET parameter is omitted, no file will
	    be written, instead the resulting mapping table is displayed
	    in text form.

   EXAMPLES
	1> BUILDMAPTABLE CP1258.TXT

	Will parse the text file CP1258.TXT and display a list of
	entries with the index on the left and the Unicode codepoint at
	the right side. Note: unmapped entries (with Unicode codepoint 0)
	are not displayed.

	2> BUILDMAPTABLE 8859-1.TXT CHARSET LATIN1

	Will parse the text file 8859-1.TXT and create the file
	L:Charsets/ISO-8859-1 (latin1 is an alias for ISO-8859-1)
	which is useless (the ISO-8859-1 mapping table is a builtin
	part of diskfont.library and will not be loaded from disk).
