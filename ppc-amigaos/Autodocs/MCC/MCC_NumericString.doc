   NumericString.mcc was originally developed by Flavio Stanchina.
   This is a native reimplementation included with MUI5 for convenience.

   MUI's String class allows you to get and set its contents as a LONG, but
   that's it: you don't have a real numeric string gadget that takes input
   validation upon itself, and maybe offers some additional useful services.
   On the other hand, there are at least three numeric input classes available
   in MUI, but some applications could need a traditional string gadget
   because the acceptable range of input values doesn't fit well in the limits
   of a slider or a knob.
   NumericString.mcc is a subclass of Group class which features a string and
   two arrow buttons for incrementing/decrementing the numeric value, like
   other platforms' numeric strings have.
   This class understands almost all attributes of String.mui plus some of
   Numeric.mui as well as some methods of Numeric.mui which let it behave like
   a real numeric string object should. This document covers which methods and
   attributes are inherited from Numeric.mui and String.mui and attributes
   whose behaviour is changed. Please refer to the String.mui class Autodoc
   for additional attributes.

   NumericString.mcc supports the following attributes and methods of
   Numeric.mui:
     - MUIA_Numeric_Max (defaults to 100)
     - MUIA_Numeric_Min (defaults to 0)
     - MUIA_Numeric_Value (defaults to 0, values will be clipped in respect to
         MUIA_Numeric_Min/Max)
     - MUIM_Numeric_Decrease
     - MUIM_Numeric_Inccrease

   For the embedded string object these attributes will be set by default:
     - MUIA_String_Accept: "-0123456789"
       no negative numbers are accepted if MUIA_Numeric_Min is >= 0
       the minus character will be automatically rejected aswell in that case
     - MUIA_String_Format: MUIV_String_Format_Right
     - MUIA_String_MaxLen: 12

   Setting the following String.mui attributes is discouraged:
     - MUIA_String_Accept/Reject (the default is adequate, see above)

   Setting the following String.mui attributes is forbidden:
     - MUIA_String_Contents (set MUIA_Numeric_Value instead)
     - MUIA_String_Integer  (set MUIA_Numeric_Value instead)

   Getting any attributes of Numeric.mui or String.mui or adding notifications
   for them is ok.
